# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and syntax of the `mke2fs` command in Linux, which is used to create new ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems on a specified partition or block device. We explored the key options of the `mke2fs` command, such as setting the filesystem type, block size, bytes-per-inode ratio, volume label, and various filesystem features. We then demonstrated how to create an Ext4 filesystem on a new partition using the `mke2fs` command.
