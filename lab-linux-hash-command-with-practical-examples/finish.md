# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Linux `hash` command, which is used to calculate cryptographic hash values of files and directories. We explored the basic usage of the `hash` command, including how to specify the hashing algorithm, verify file integrity, and calculate hashes for files and directories. We created a sample file and used the `hash` command to calculate its SHA-256 hash value. This tool is valuable for verifying the integrity of data and performing other security-related tasks.
