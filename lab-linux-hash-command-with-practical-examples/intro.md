# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `hash` command, which is used to calculate cryptographic hash values of files and directories. This command is a powerful tool for verifying the integrity of data and performing other security-related tasks. We will start by introducing the `hash` command, then learn how to calculate hashes of files and directories, and finally, how to use the `hash` command to verify file integrity. The `hash` command is part of the GNU coreutils package, which is a collection of essential command-line tools for the Linux operating system.
