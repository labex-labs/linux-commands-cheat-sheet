# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `bzgrep` command in Linux, which is used to search for patterns in compressed files in the bzip2 format. You explored the basic usage of `bzgrep`, including specifying a pattern to search for, searching specific files, and using various options like case-insensitive search, showing line numbers, and inverting the search. Additionally, you learned how to combine `bzgrep` with other Linux commands for more advanced searches in compressed files.

You then practiced using `bzgrep` to search for patterns in a sample compressed file, demonstrating its flexibility and effectiveness in working with compressed data.
