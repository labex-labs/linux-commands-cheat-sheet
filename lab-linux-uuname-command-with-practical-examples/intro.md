# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `uuname` command, which is used to retrieve information about the local system. The `uuname` command is part of the `uucp` (Unix-to-Unix Copy) package and provides details such as the system name, node name, release, version, and machine hardware name. We will also learn how to combine `uuname` with other Linux commands to perform more advanced tasks. The lab covers understanding the `uuname` command, retrieving system information using `uuname`, and combining `uuname` with other Linux commands.
