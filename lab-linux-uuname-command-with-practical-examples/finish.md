# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `uuname` command in Linux, which is used to retrieve information about the local system. We started by understanding the purpose of the `uuname` command and how to check its version. We then explored the various options available with `uuname` to retrieve system information, such as the system name, node name, release, version, and machine hardware name. Finally, we learned how to combine `uuname` with other Linux commands, like `grep`, to filter the output and perform more advanced tasks.
