# Combine uuname with Other Linux Commands

In this final step, we will explore how to combine the `uuname` command with other Linux commands to perform more advanced tasks.

One common use case is to use `uuname` with `grep` to filter the output. For example, let's say we want to check if the system is running a specific version of Ubuntu:

```bash
uuname -a | grep "Ubuntu 22.04"
```

Example output:

```
ubuntu Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS x86_64
```

This command retrieves the full system information using `uuname -a` and then filters the output using `grep` to only show lines containing the text "Ubuntu 22.04".

Another example is to use `uuname` with `awk` to extract specific pieces of information:

```bash
uuname -a | awk '{print $1, $3}'
```

Example output:

```
ubuntu 22.04
```

This command retrieves the full system information using `uuname -a` and then uses `awk` to print the first and third fields, which correspond to the system name and release, respectively.

You can also combine `uuname` with other commands to perform more complex tasks. For example, you could use `uuname` to get the system name and then use that information to perform other actions:

```bash
system_name=$(uuname -s)
echo "The system name is: $system_name"
```

Example output:

```
The system name is: ubuntu
```

This command retrieves the system name using `uuname -s` and stores it in the `system_name` variable, which can then be used in further commands or scripts.

By combining `uuname` with other Linux commands, you can create powerful scripts and workflows to automate various system administration tasks.
