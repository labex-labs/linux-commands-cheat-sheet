# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the cpio command in Linux. The cpio command is a powerful tool used for creating and extracting archives, as well as performing selective archiving and extraction. You explored the three different modes of the cpio command: copy-out mode for creating archives, copy-in mode for extracting archives, and copy-pass mode for copying files from one directory to another. You also learned the basic syntax for creating and extracting archives using cpio.

Next, you practiced creating and extracting archives using the cpio command. You created a sample directory and files, then used the cpio -o command to create an archive. To extract the files from the archive, you used the cpio -i command.
