# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `sysctl` command in Linux to view and modify kernel parameters at runtime. The `sysctl` command allows you to fine-tune the behavior of your Linux system by adjusting various kernel-level settings, such as networking, memory management, and security configurations. You will start by understanding the purpose and functionality of the `sysctl` command, then learn how to modify kernel parameters using the command, and finally, explore how to persist these configuration changes across system reboots.
