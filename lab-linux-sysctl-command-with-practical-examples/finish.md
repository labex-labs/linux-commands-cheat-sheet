# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and functionality of the sysctl command in Linux, which allows you to view and modify kernel parameters at runtime. You discovered how to use the sysctl command to view the current value of a kernel parameter, as well as how to modify the value of a parameter using the -w or --write option. Additionally, you learned that the sysctl command provides access to a wide range of kernel parameters, enabling you to customize and optimize your Linux system for specific use cases. Finally, you explored how to modify multiple kernel parameters simultaneously using the sysctl command.
