# Analyze the Output of objdump on a Simple C Program

In this final step, you will analyze the output of the `objdump` command in more detail, focusing on the `hello` program we created earlier.

Let's start by taking a closer look at the disassembly output:

```bash
objdump -d hello
```

Example output:

```
hello:     file format elf64-x86-64

Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000001089 <main>:
    1089:   f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
    108d:   55                      push   %rbp
    108e:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
    1091:   bf 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%edi
    1096:   e8 85 fe ff ff          callq  f20 <puts@plt>
    109b:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax
    10a0:   5d                      pop    %rbp
    10a1:   c3                      retq
```

The disassembly output shows the machine instructions that make up the `main` function of the `hello` program. Let's break down the instructions:

1. `f3 0f 1e fa`: This is the `endbr64` instruction, which is a security feature to prevent certain types of attacks.
2. `55`: This is the `push %rbp` instruction, which saves the base pointer register on the stack.
3. `48 89 e5`: This is the `mov %rsp,%rbp` instruction, which sets the base pointer to the current stack pointer.
4. `bf 00 00 00 00`: This is the `mov $0x0,%edi` instruction, which sets the first argument (the file descriptor) to 0 for the `puts` function call.
5. `e8 85 fe ff ff`: This is the `callq  f20 <puts@plt>` instruction, which calls the `puts` function to print the "Hello, World!" message.
6. `b8 00 00 00 00`: This is the `mov $0x0,%eax` instruction, which sets the return value of the `main` function to 0.
7. `5d`: This is the `pop %rbp` instruction, which restores the base pointer from the stack.
8. `c3`: This is the `retq` instruction, which returns from the `main` function.

By understanding the disassembly output, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the `hello` program works at a low level. This can be especially useful for debugging issues or reverse-engineering software.
