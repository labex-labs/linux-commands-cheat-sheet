# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `mcd` command in Linux, which stands for "make and change directory". The `mcd` command allows you to create a new directory and change the current working directory to the newly created directory in a single command. You also learned how to use `mcd` to create a series of nested directories efficiently, which is particularly useful when you need to organize your files and directories in a hierarchical structure.

Additionally, you discovered how to combine `mcd` with other Linux commands for more advanced file and directory operations, enabling you to streamline your workflow and improve your productivity in the terminal.
