# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `mcd` command, which stands for "make and change directory". The `mcd` command allows you to create a new directory and change the current working directory to the newly created directory in a single command. You will explore how to use `mcd` to efficiently create nested directories and combine it with other Linux commands for advanced file and directory operations.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `mcd` command
2. Create nested directories with `mcd`
3. Combine `mcd` with other Linux commands
