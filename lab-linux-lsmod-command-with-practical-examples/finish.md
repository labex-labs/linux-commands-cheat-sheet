# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose of the `lsmod` command, which is used to display information about the kernel modules currently loaded on the system. You then explored the output of the `lsmod` command, understanding that it provides the name, size, and usage information for each loaded kernel module. Finally, you covered the process of loading and unloading kernel modules using the `modprobe` and `rmmod` commands.
