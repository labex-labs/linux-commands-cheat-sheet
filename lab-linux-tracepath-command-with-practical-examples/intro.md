# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `tracepath` command to trace the path taken by packets from the local host to a remote host, and to identify any network issues along the way. The lab covers the purpose of the `tracepath` command, how to use it to trace the path to a remote host, and how to troubleshoot network issues using the command. You will learn to interpret the output of the `tracepath` command and use it to identify potential network problems, such as high latency, packet loss, or MTU issues.
