# Troubleshoot Network Issues with tracepath

In this step, you will learn how to use the `tracepath` command to troubleshoot network issues.

Let's start by simulating a network issue by blocking the connection to a remote host using the `iptables` firewall:

```
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d 8.8.8.8 -j DROP
```

This command will block all outgoing traffic to the IP address `8.8.8.8`, which is one of Google's public DNS servers.

Now, let's try to trace the path to `8.8.8.8` using the `tracepath` command:

```
$ sudo tracepath 8.8.8.8
 1?: [LOCALHOST]                                         pmtu 1500
 1:  192.168.1.1                                           0.161ms
 1:  192.168.1.1                                           0.158ms
 2:  10.0.0.1                                              1.694ms
 3:  no reply
 4:  no reply
 5:  no reply
     Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 5 back 2
```

Example output:

The output shows that the `tracepath` command was able to trace the path up to the third hop, but then encountered a "no reply" message, indicating that the connection was blocked or the remote host was not responding.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the firewall rules to ensure that the connection is being blocked as expected:

   ```
   $ sudo iptables -L
   Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
   target     prot opt source               destination
   DROP       all  --  anywhere             8.8.8.8
   ```

2. Try pinging the remote host to see if the connection is actually blocked:

   ```
   $ ping 8.8.8.8
   PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
   ^C
   --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
   3 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 2023ms
   ```

   The output shows that the connection is being blocked, as indicated by the 100% packet loss.

3. Remove the firewall rule to restore the connection:

   ```
   $ sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -d 8.8.8.8 -j DROP
   ```

By using the `tracepath` command to identify the point where the connection is being blocked, you can quickly troubleshoot network issues and identify the root cause.
