# Summary

In this lab, you will learn about the purpose and usage of the `tracepath` command in Linux, which is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path taken by packets from the local host to a remote host and identify any intermediate hops or network issues along the way. You will also learn how to use the `tracepath` command to trace the path to a remote host and troubleshoot network issues using the command's output.

The `tracepath` command is similar to the `traceroute` command, but it uses the Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) mechanism to determine the maximum transmission unit (MTU) along the path, which can help identify network issues related to packet fragmentation. By running the `tracepath` command, you can identify any network issues or bottlenecks along the path, such as high latency, packet loss, or MTU issues.
