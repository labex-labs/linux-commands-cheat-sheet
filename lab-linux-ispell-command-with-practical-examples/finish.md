# Summary

In this lab, we first installed the ispell command-line spell checker on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container by updating the package index and then installing the ispell package. We then learned how to use ispell to check the spelling of a single word and a text file, which can be helpful for proofreading and ensuring the accuracy of written documents.
