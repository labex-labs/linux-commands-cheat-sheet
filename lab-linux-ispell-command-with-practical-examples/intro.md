# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the usage of the ispell command-line spell checker on an Ubuntu 22.04 system. We will start by installing the ispell package, and then demonstrate how to use it to check the spelling of a single word and a text file. The ispell command is a powerful tool for proofreading and editing text documents, and this lab will provide practical examples to help you get started with its usage.
