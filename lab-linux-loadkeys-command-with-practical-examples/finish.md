# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `loadkeys` command in Linux, which is used to load a keyboard translation table from a file and change the keyboard layout on the system. We started by understanding the `loadkeys` command and how to check the current keyboard layout. Then, we explored various options to change the keyboard layout, such as loading the default keyboard map, French keyboard map, and German keyboard map. Finally, we learned how to change the keyboard layout to a specific layout, such as French, and verify the changes.
