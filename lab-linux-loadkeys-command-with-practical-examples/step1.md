# Understanding the loadkeys Command

In this step, we will learn about the `loadkeys` command in Linux. The `loadkeys` command is used to load a keyboard translation table from a file. This allows you to change the keyboard layout on your system.

To begin, let's check the current keyboard layout using the `loadkeys` command:

```bash
loadkeys -c
```

Example output:

```
keycode  30 = a A
keycode  31 = b B
keycode  32 = c C
...
```

This output shows the current keyboard mapping for your system. The `keycode` represents the key on the keyboard, and the characters after the `=` represent the corresponding characters that will be generated when that key is pressed.

Next, let's explore some of the options available with the `loadkeys` command:

- `loadkeys -d`: Loads the default keyboard map.
- `loadkeys fr`: Loads the French keyboard map.
- `loadkeys de-latin1`: Loads the German keyboard map.

You can find a list of available keyboard maps by running `ls /usr/share/keymaps/`. These map files are typically located in the `/usr/share/keymaps/` directory.
