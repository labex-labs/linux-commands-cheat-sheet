# Customizing the Keyboard Layout with loadkeys

In this step, we will learn how to customize the keyboard layout using the `loadkeys` command.

First, let's create a custom keyboard map file. We'll use the `us.map` file as a starting point and modify it to our needs.

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.map ~/project/custom_keymap.map
```

Now, open the `custom_keymap.map` file in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/project/custom_keymap.map
```

In the file, you can find the mapping for each key. For example, the mapping for the 'a' key is:

```
keycode  30 = a A
```

Let's change the mapping for the 'a' key to map it to 'x' instead:

```
keycode  30 = x X
```

Save the file and exit the editor.

Now, let's load the custom keyboard map:

```bash
sudo loadkeys ~/project/custom_keymap.map
```

Example output:

```
Loading ~/project/custom_keymap.map
```

To verify the changes, let's check the keyboard layout again:

```bash
loadkeys -c
```

You should see the custom mapping for the 'a' key, where it is now mapped to 'x'.
