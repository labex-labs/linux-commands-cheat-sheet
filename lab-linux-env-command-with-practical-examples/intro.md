# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `env` command and learn how to use it to manage environment variables and execute commands with custom environments. We will start by understanding the purpose and usage of the `env` command, then learn how to modify environment variables using it. Finally, we will practice executing commands with custom environment variables. The `env` command is a useful utility for running commands in a specific environment, which can be particularly helpful when working with different sets of environment variables.
