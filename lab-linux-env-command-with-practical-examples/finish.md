# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and usage of the `env` command in Linux. We learned how to print the current environment variables, create and modify new environment variables, and execute commands with custom environment variables. We also discovered how to remove an environment variable using the `env` command. These skills are useful when you need to run a command in a specific environment or manage environment variables in your shell.
