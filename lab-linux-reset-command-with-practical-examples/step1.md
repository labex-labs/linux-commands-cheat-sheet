# Understand the Purpose of the reset Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `reset` command in Linux. The `reset` command is used to restore the terminal to a known state, which can be useful when the terminal has become unresponsive or has been corrupted.

To understand the purpose of the `reset` command, let's first try to corrupt the terminal by running the following command:

```bash
echo -e "\033[1;31mThis is a corrupted terminal\033[0m"
```

Example output:

```
This is a corrupted terminal
```

As you can see, the terminal has been corrupted, and the text is displayed in red. To restore the terminal to a known state, you can use the `reset` command:

```bash
reset
```

Example output:

```
reset
```

After running the `reset` command, the terminal should be restored to its default state, and you should be able to use the terminal normally.

The `reset` command works by resetting the terminal settings, including the cursor position, color settings, and other terminal-specific configurations. This can be useful when the terminal has become unresponsive or has been corrupted, as it allows you to restore the terminal to a known state and continue working.
