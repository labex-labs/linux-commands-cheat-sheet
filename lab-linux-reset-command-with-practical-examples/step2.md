# Restore the Terminal to a Known State

In this step, you will learn how to restore the terminal to a known state using the `reset` command.

Sometimes, the terminal may become unresponsive or corrupted, making it difficult to use. In such cases, you can use the `reset` command to restore the terminal to its default state.

To restore the terminal to a known state, follow these steps:

1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + F2` to switch to a different virtual console (VT2).
2. Run the `reset` command:

```bash
reset
```

Example output:

```
reset
```

3. Press `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to switch back to the original virtual console (VT1).

After running the `reset` command, the terminal should be restored to its default state, and you should be able to use it normally.

The `reset` command works by resetting the terminal settings, including the cursor position, color settings, and other terminal-specific configurations. This can be useful when the terminal has become unresponsive or has been corrupted, as it allows you to restore the terminal to a known state and continue working.
