# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `lastb` command, which is used to display information about failed login attempts on the system. The `lastb` command provides valuable insights into potential security threats and user activity, helping system administrators and security professionals monitor the system more effectively.

We will start by understanding the purpose of the `lastb` command, then dive into its syntax and available options. Finally, we will analyze the output of the `lastb` command to identify patterns of failed login attempts and take appropriate actions to secure the system.
