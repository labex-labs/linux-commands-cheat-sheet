# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and usage of the `lastb` command in Linux. The `lastb` command is used to display information about failed login attempts on the system, which can help system administrators and security professionals identify potential security threats and monitor user activity.

We learned how to run the `lastb` command to view the username, terminal, login time, and duration of failed login attempts. We also explored various options for the `lastb` command, such as displaying the hostname or IP address of the remote host, the details of the login session, and the last number of failed login attempts. These features provide valuable information for analyzing and investigating security incidents on the system.
