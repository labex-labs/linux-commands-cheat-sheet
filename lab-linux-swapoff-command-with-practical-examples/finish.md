In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `swapoff` command in Linux, which is used to disable swap partitions or swap files. You started by checking the current swap usage on your system using the `free` command, and then proceeded to disable the swap using the `swapoff -a` command. After disabling the swap, you verified that the swap space was no longer in use. Additionally, you learned how to identify the swap partitions and swap files on your Linux system using the `free` command.
