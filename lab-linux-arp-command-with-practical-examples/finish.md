# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose of the `arp` command in Linux, which is used to manage the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. The ARP cache is a table that maps IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses on a local network, allowing the operating system to quickly look up the MAC address associated with a given IP address for network communication.

Next, you explored the basic syntax and options of the `arp` command, including displaying the current ARP cache, deleting entries, manually adding entries, specifying the network interface, and displaying IP addresses instead of hostnames. These basic commands and options provide the necessary tools to effectively manage the ARP cache on a Linux system.
