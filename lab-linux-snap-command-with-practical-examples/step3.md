# Managing Snap Packages with Snap Commands

In this final step, we will explore more advanced Snap package management commands to help you effectively manage your Snap packages.

First, let's list all the Snap packages available in the Snap store:

```bash
sudo snap find
```

Example output:

```
Name                 Version  Publisher   Notes
vlc                  3.0.17.3 videolan    -
gimp                 2.10.30  snapcrafters -
libreoffice          7.3.5.2  libreoffice -
firefox              103.0.2  mozilla     -
code                 1.71.2   microsoft   classic
```

This command searches the Snap store and lists all the available Snap packages.

You can also search for a specific Snap package by providing a search term:

```bash
sudo snap find gimp
```

Example output:

```
Name        Version  Publisher   Notes
gimp        2.10.30  snapcrafters -
```

To get more detailed information about a Snap package, you can use the `snap info` command:

```bash
sudo snap info gimp
```

Example output:

```
name:      gimp
summary:   GNU Image Manipulation Program
publisher: snapcrafters
store-url: https://snapcraft.io/gimp
contact:   https://github.com/snapcrafters/gimp/issues
license:   GPL-3.0
description: |
  GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.
```

This command provides detailed information about the GIMP Snap package, including its summary, publisher, contact information, license, and description.

Finally, let's explore the Snap package channels. Snap packages can be installed from different channels, such as `stable`, `candidate`, `beta`, and `edge`. You can use the `snap info` command to see the available channels for a Snap package:

```bash
sudo snap info gimp
```

Example output:

```
name:      gimp
summary:   GNU Image Manipulation Program
publisher: snapcrafters
store-url: https://snapcraft.io/gimp
contact:   https://github.com/snapcrafters/gimp/issues
license:   GPL-3.0
channels:
  stable:   2.10.30
  candidate: 2.10.30
  beta:      2.10.30
  edge:      2.10.30
```

This output shows that the GIMP Snap package is available in the `stable`, `candidate`, `beta`, and `edge` channels, all with the same version (2.10.30).

You've now learned how to manage Snap packages using various Snap commands. Congratulations on completing this Linux Snap package management lab!
