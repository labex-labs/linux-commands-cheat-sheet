# Summary

In this lab, we first introduced the Snap package manager and explored its key features, including its ability to provide self-contained applications with all necessary dependencies. We learned how to check the Snap version installed on the system and list all the Snap packages currently installed.

Next, we covered the process of installing and updating Snap packages. We demonstrated how to install the VLC media player using the Snap package manager, and then discussed the steps to update Snap packages to their latest versions. We also explored the use of Snap commands to manage Snap packages, such as removing, refreshing, and searching for packages.
