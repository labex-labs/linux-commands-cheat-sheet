# Understand the swatch Command

In this step, you will learn about the swatch command, a powerful tool for monitoring log files and setting up custom alerts in Linux.

The swatch (System Wide Analyzer and Tracker) command is used to monitor system log files and trigger actions based on specific patterns or events. It can be configured to watch for specific log entries and perform various actions, such as sending notifications, executing scripts, or forwarding the log entries to other systems.

Let's start by installing the swatch package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y swatch
```

The swatch command reads log files and checks each line for patterns specified in a configuration file. When a match is found, swatch can perform various actions, such as sending an email, executing a script, or logging the event.

To understand the basic usage of swatch, let's create a simple configuration file:

```bash
nano ~/project/swatch.config
```

Add the following content to the file:

```
# swatch.config
watchfor /error/
actions = echo "Error found: $_"
```

This configuration file tells swatch to watch for the word "error" in the log files and, when found, execute the `echo` command to print a message.

Now, let's run swatch to monitor the system log file:

```bash
swatch --config-file ~/project/swatch.config --tail /var/log/syslog
```

The `--tail` option tells swatch to continuously monitor the log file and watch for new entries.

Example output:

```
Error found: Apr 12 10:15:32 ubuntu sshd[1234]: error: could not open log file
```

In this example, swatch detected the word "error" in the `/var/log/syslog` file and executed the configured action to print a message.

The swatch command provides a wide range of options and configuration settings to customize the monitoring and alert behavior. In the next steps, you will learn how to configure swatch for more advanced use cases.
