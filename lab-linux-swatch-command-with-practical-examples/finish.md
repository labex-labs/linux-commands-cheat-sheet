# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the swatch command, a powerful tool for monitoring log files and setting up custom alerts in Linux. You started by installing the swatch package and then created a simple configuration file to watch for the word "error" in the log files and execute a command when a match is found. You also learned how to monitor log files with swatch and configure it for specific alerts, such as sending notifications or executing scripts based on log events.
