# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the swatch command, a powerful tool for monitoring log files and setting up custom alerts in Linux. The lab covers understanding the swatch command, monitoring log files with swatch, and configuring swatch for specific alerts.

The swatch (System Wide Analyzer and Tracker) command is used to monitor system log files and trigger actions based on specific patterns or events. It can be configured to watch for specific log entries and perform various actions, such as sending notifications, executing scripts, or forwarding the log entries to other systems. The lab starts by installing the swatch package, which may require additional dependencies. The lab then guides you through creating a simple configuration file to watch for the word "error" in the log files and execute a command when a match is found.
