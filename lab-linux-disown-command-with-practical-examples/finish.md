# Summary

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `disown` command in Linux to detach running processes from the current shell session. This allows the processes to continue running in the background, even after you log out or close the terminal. You will start a background process, then use the `disown` command to detach it, ensuring it continues to run. Additionally, you will learn how to disown multiple processes and manage their output. The `disown` command is useful for running long-running tasks, such as backups or web servers, without the need to keep the terminal open.
