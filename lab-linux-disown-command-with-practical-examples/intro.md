# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `disown` command and how to use it to detach running processes from the shell, allowing them to continue executing even after you log out of the system or close the terminal. The lab covers understanding the purpose of the `disown` command, detaching a running process in the background, and managing the output of multiple disowned processes. This knowledge can be useful for running long-running tasks, such as backup scripts or web servers, without the need to keep the terminal session open.
