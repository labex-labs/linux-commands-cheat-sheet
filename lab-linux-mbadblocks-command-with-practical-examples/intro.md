# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `mbadblocks` command in Linux to identify, locate, and manage bad blocks on a file system. The `mbadblocks` command is a utility that helps you scan a file system, mark bad blocks as unusable, remap bad blocks to spare blocks, and repair file systems by relocating data from bad blocks to good blocks. This lab provides practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you effectively utilize the `mbadblocks` command in your Linux environment.
