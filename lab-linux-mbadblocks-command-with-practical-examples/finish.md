# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and functionality of the mbadblocks command in Linux, which is used to identify and manage bad blocks on a file system. The mbadblocks command can scan a file system, mark bad blocks as unusable, remap bad blocks to spare blocks, and repair file systems by relocating data from bad blocks to good blocks. You also learned how to identify and locate bad blocks on a Linux file system using the mbadblocks command, and how to repair and manage bad blocks using the same tool.
