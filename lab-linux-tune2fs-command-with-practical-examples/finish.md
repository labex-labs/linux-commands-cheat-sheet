# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `tune2fs` command, a powerful tool for managing ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems. We learned how to use `tune2fs` to modify various file system parameters without the need to unmount the file system. We also discovered how to backup and restore file system metadata using `tune2fs`. By understanding the capabilities of `tune2fs`, we can effectively manage and maintain the health of our file systems.
