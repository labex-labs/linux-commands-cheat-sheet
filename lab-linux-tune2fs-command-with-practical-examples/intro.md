# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `tune2fs` command, a powerful tool for managing ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems. The `tune2fs` command allows you to modify various file system parameters without the need to unmount the file system. We will first understand the `tune2fs` command, then learn how to modify the file system behavior using `tune2fs`, and finally, we will cover how to backup and restore file system metadata with `tune2fs`.
