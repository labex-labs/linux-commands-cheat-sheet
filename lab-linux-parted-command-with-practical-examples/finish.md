# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the `parted` command, which is a powerful tool for managing disk partitions in Linux. You explored the various subcommands available in `parted`, such as `print`, `unit`, `mkpart`, `rm`, `resizepart`, and `rescue`, which allow you to create, resize, and delete partitions on your storage devices. You also learned how to check the version of `parted` installed on your system and how to access the built-in help to get more information about the command and its usage.

Next, you created a new virtual disk image file that you can use for your partitioning exercises. You then learned how to create and manage partitions on this storage device using the `parted` command, including resizing and deleting partitions as needed.
