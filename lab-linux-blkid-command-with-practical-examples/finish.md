# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `blkid` command, a powerful tool in Linux for identifying filesystem types and querying disk attributes. We learned how to use `blkid` to locate and print block device information, including filesystem type, UUID, labels, and more. We also discovered how to filter the output to show only block devices with a specific filesystem type.

The `blkid` command is a versatile tool that can be used to gather detailed information about the storage devices on a Linux system. By understanding how to effectively use `blkid`, system administrators and users can better manage and troubleshoot their Linux environments.
