# Customize the more Command Behavior and Explore Advanced Features

In this final step, you will learn how to customize the behavior of the `more` command and explore some of its advanced features.

First, let's try using the `-d` (prompt) option to display helpful prompts while using the `more` command:

```
$ more -d example.txt
```

This will display prompts like "Press space to continue, 'q' to quit." to guide you through the file navigation.

You can also use the `-c` (clear) option to clear the screen before displaying each page:

```
$ more -c example.txt
```

This can make the output easier to read, especially for large files.

Another useful feature of the `more` command is its ability to display line numbers. You can enable this by using the `-n` option:

```
$ more -n example.txt
```

This will display the line numbers on the left side of the output.

Finally, the `more` command also supports advanced search and navigation features. You can use the following commands while viewing a file:

- `/pattern` - Search forward for a pattern
- `?pattern` - Search backward for a pattern
- `n` - Repeat the last search in the same direction
- `N` - Repeat the last search in the opposite direction

For example, to search for the word "linux" and navigate through the results:

```
/linux
n
N
```

This allows you to quickly find and navigate through all occurrences of the word "linux" in the file.
