In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `diff3` command to compare and merge three files with conflicting changes. The `diff3` command is a powerful tool that helps you identify and resolve conflicts when working with multiple versions of a file. You will start by understanding the purpose and syntax of the `diff3` command, and then learn how to use it to merge conflicting files. This lab will provide you with practical examples and steps to help you become proficient in using the `diff3` command for your scripting and programming tasks.

The `diff3` command is a useful tool for resolving conflicts in a three-way merge, which is a common scenario when working with version control systems or collaborating on shared files.
