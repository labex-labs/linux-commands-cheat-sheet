# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of diff3 Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `diff3` command in Linux. The `diff3` command is used to compare three files and identify the differences between them.

The syntax of the `diff3` command is as follows:

```
diff3 [options] file1 file2 file3
```

Here, `file1`, `file2`, and `file3` are the three files you want to compare.

Some common options for the `diff3` command include:

- `-E`: Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line.
- `-a`: Treat all files as text, even if they do not contain text.
- `-L label`: Use the given label instead of the file name.
- `-m`: Show the merged output, highlighting conflicts.

To understand the purpose of the `diff3` command, let's consider a scenario where you have three files with some conflicting changes. You can use the `diff3` command to merge these files and resolve the conflicts.
