# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `exec` command and its practical applications. We will start by understanding the `exec` system call, which is used to execute a program or command in the current process, replacing the current process image with a new process image. We will then demonstrate how to execute external commands using the `exec` system call, as well as how to redirect input and output with `exec()`. This lab aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the `exec` command and its various use cases in Linux.
