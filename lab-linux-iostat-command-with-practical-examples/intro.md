# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `iostat` command, which is a powerful tool for monitoring system input/output (I/O) performance, including CPU utilization and disk I/O statistics. We will start by understanding the purpose and usage of the `iostat` command, including how to install the required `sysstat` package and run the basic `iostat` command to view CPU and I/O statistics. Then, we will dive deeper into analyzing the CPU and I/O statistics provided by `iostat`, as well as monitoring disk I/O performance using the command.
