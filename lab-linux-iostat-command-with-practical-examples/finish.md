# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the `iostat` command in Linux. The `iostat` command is a powerful tool for monitoring system input/output (I/O) performance, including CPU utilization and disk I/O statistics. We installed the `sysstat` package and ran the `iostat` command to view the basic CPU and I/O statistics, as well as more detailed statistics for specific devices. We also learned how to analyze the CPU and I/O statistics provided by the `iostat` command, including transactions per second, read and write throughput, and total read and write data.
