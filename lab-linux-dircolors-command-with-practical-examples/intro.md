# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `dircolors` command in Linux to customize the color scheme for directory and file listings in the terminal. The `dircolors` command reads a configuration file that specifies the color settings for different file types and directory types, typically located at `~/.dircolors` or `/etc/DIR_COLORS`. You will start by understanding the purpose of the `dircolors` command, then learn how to customize the directory and file colors, and finally manage the `dircolors` configuration files.
