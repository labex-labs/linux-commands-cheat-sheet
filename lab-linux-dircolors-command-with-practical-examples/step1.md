# Understand the Purpose of dircolors Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `dircolors` command in Linux. The `dircolors` command is used to customize the color scheme for directory and file listings in the terminal.

The `dircolors` command reads a configuration file that specifies the color settings for different file types and directory types. This configuration file is typically located at `~/.dircolors` or `/etc/DIR_COLORS`.

Let's start by checking the current color settings on your system:

```bash
dircolors --print-database
```

Example output:

```
# Configuration file for dircolors, a utility to help you set the
# LS_COLORS environment variable used by GNU ls with the --color option.

# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
# string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
# Attribute codes:
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
NORMAL 00 # global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00 # normal file
DIR 01;34 # directory
LINK 01;36 # symbolic link
FIFO 33 # pipe
SOCK 01;35 # socket
DOOR 01;35 # door
BLK 01;33 # block device driver
CHR 01;33 # character device driver
ORPHAN 01;05;37;41 # orphaned symlinks
MISSING 01;05;37;41 # ... and the files they point to
EXEC 01;32 # executable file
```

The output shows the current color settings for different file types and directory types. You can customize these settings by modifying the `~/.dircolors` configuration file.

In the next step, you will learn how to customize the directory and file colors using the `dircolors` command.
