# Understand the bzdiff Command

In this step, we will learn about the `bzdiff` command in Linux, which is used to compare compressed files. The `bzdiff` command is part of the `bzip2` package and allows you to compare the contents of two compressed files without the need to decompress them first.

To get started, let's first install the `bzip2` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bzip2
```

Now, let's create two compressed files using `bzip2` to demonstrate the usage of `bzdiff`:

```bash
# Create a compressed file
echo "This is the first file" | bzip2 > file1.txt.bz2

# Create another compressed file with different content
echo "This is the second file" | bzip2 > file2.txt.bz2
```

To compare the two compressed files, we can use the `bzdiff` command:

```bash
bzdiff file1.txt.bz2 file2.txt.bz2
```

Example output:

```
Files file1.txt.bz2 and file2.txt.bz2 differ
```

The output shows that the two compressed files have different contents.
