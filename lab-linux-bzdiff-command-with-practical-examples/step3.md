# Explore Advanced bzdiff Options

In this final step, we will explore some advanced options available with the `bzdiff` command.

One useful option is the `-s` or `--silent` flag, which suppresses the output of `bzdiff` and only returns the exit status. This can be helpful when you want to use `bzdiff` in scripts or other automated processes:

```bash
bzdiff -s file1.txt.bz2 file2.txt.bz2
echo $?  # 1 if the files differ, 0 if the files are identical
```

Another option is the `-q` or `--quiet` flag, which only prints a message if the files differ, without showing the specific differences:

```bash
bzdiff -q file1.txt.bz2 file2.txt.bz2
# No output if the files are identical, "Files file1.txt.bz2 and file2.txt.bz2 differ" if they differ
```

You can also use the `--version` option to display the version of the `bzip2` package that includes the `bzdiff` command:

```bash
bzdiff --version
# Output: bzip2, a block-sorting file compressor, version 1.0.8
```

Finally, the `bzdiff` command supports the same set of options as the `diff` command, so you can use those options as well. For example, the `-u` or `--unified` option will display the differences in a unified diff format:

```bash
bzdiff -u file1.txt.bz2 file2.txt.bz2
# Output: Unified diff of the compressed files
```

These advanced options can be useful when integrating `bzdiff` into more complex workflows or scripts.
