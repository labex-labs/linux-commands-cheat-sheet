# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `bzdiff` command, which is used to compare the contents of compressed files without the need to decompress them first. We will start by understanding the basic usage of `bzdiff`, then dive deeper into comparing compressed files and exploring advanced options. The `bzip2` package, which includes the `bzdiff` command, may need to be installed on some systems. This lab provides practical examples to help you effectively utilize the `bzdiff` command in your Linux workflow.
