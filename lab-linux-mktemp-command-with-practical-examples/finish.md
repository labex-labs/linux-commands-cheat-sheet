# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `mktemp` command, which is used to create temporary files and directories. We learned the basic syntax of the `mktemp` command and how to create temporary files with unique names in the default system temporary directory or with a custom template. We also discussed the importance of securing temporary files to ensure they do not conflict with other processes.
