# Securing Temporary Files with mktemp

In this step, we will explore how to use the `mktemp` command to create secure temporary files and directories.

One of the key features of `mktemp` is its ability to create temporary files with secure permissions. By default, the temporary files created by `mktemp` have the following permissions:

- The file is owned by the current user.
- The file has read-write permissions for the owner (0600).
- The file is not accessible by other users.

This ensures that the temporary files are secure and cannot be accessed by other users on the system.

Let's see an example of creating a secure temporary file:

```bash
$ mktemp --mode=0600 /tmp/myfile.XXXXXX
/tmp/myfile.Hx6Ixq8Bxe
```

In this example, the `--mode` option is used to set the file permissions to 0600 (read-write for the owner).

You can also create secure temporary directories using the `-d` option:

```bash
$ mktemp -d --mode=0700 /tmp/mydir.XXXXXX
/tmp/mydir.Hx6Ixq8Bxe
```

The `-d` option creates a temporary directory, and the `--mode=0700` option sets the directory permissions to be accessible only by the owner.

By using the secure options provided by `mktemp`, you can ensure that your temporary files and directories are protected from unauthorized access, which is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your system.
