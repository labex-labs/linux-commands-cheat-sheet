# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and syntax of the `cd` command in Linux, which is used to change the current working directory. We explored how to navigate the file system using absolute and relative paths, as well as various shortcuts like `cd ~`, `cd -`, and `cd ..`. We also practiced creating directories and files, and then using the `cd` command to navigate between them, demonstrating the flexibility and power of this essential Linux command.
