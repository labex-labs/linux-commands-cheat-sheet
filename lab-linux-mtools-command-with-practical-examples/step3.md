# Manage Floppy Disk Images with mtools

In this final step, we will learn how to manage floppy disk images using the `mtools` commands.

First, let's create a floppy disk image file:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=1440k count=1
```

This will create a 1.44MB floppy disk image file named `floppy.img`.

Now, let's format the floppy disk image:

```bash
mformat a: -f 1440
```

This will format the "a:" drive (which represents the `floppy.img` file) with a 1.44MB capacity.

Next, let's copy a file to the floppy disk image:

```bash
mcopy example.txt a:
```

This will copy the `example.txt` file from the current directory to the "a:" drive (floppy disk image).

To verify the contents of the floppy disk image, we can use the `mdir` command:

```bash
mdir a:
```

Example output:

```
Volume in drive A has no label
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

Directory for A:/

example.txt           1024 2023-04-18 15:23
               1 file
```

Finally, let's remove the file from the floppy disk image:

```bash
mdel a:example.txt
```

And verify that the file has been deleted:

```bash
mdir a:
```

Example output:

```
Volume in drive A has no label
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

Directory for A:/

               0 files
```

That's it! You have now learned how to manage floppy disk images using the `mtools` commands.
