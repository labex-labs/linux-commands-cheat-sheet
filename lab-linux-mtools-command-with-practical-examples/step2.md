As you can see, `mtools` provides a variety of commands for managing MS-DOS-based file systems, such as `mcopy`, `mdir`, `mtype`, and more.

Let's explore some of the commonly used `mtools` commands:

1. **List the contents of an MS-DOS disk image**:

   ```bash
   mcopy -ml a:
   ```

   This command will list the contents of the "a:" drive, which typically represents an MS-DOS disk image.

2. **Copy a file from the host system to an MS-DOS disk image**:

   ```bash
   mcopy example.txt a:
   ```

   This will copy the `example.txt` file from the current directory to the "a:" drive (MS-DOS disk image).

3. **Copy a file from an MS-DOS disk image to the host system**:

   ```bash
   mcopy a:example.txt .
   ```

   This will copy the `example.txt` file from the "a:" drive (MS-DOS disk image) to the current directory on the host system.

4. **Create a directory on an MS-DOS disk image**:

   ```bash
   mmd a:newdir
   ```

   This will create a new directory named "newdir" on the "a:" drive (MS-DOS disk image).

5. **Remove a directory from an MS-DOS disk image**:
   ```bash
   mrd a:newdir
   ```
   This will remove the "newdir" directory from the "a:" drive (MS-DOS disk image).

Remember, the "a:" drive typically represents an MS-DOS disk image, and you can replace it with the appropriate drive letter or path to the disk image file.
