# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the `mtools` package on Ubuntu 22.04, which provides a collection of utilities to access MS-DOS disks from Unix without mounting them. We explored the various commands and options available in `mtools` and practiced managing floppy disk images using the provided tools. The lab covered the essential steps to get started with `mtools` and demonstrated its practical applications in working with MS-DOS-formatted storage devices on a Linux system.
