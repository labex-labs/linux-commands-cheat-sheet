# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mtools` command, which is a collection of utilities to access MS-DOS disks from Unix without mounting them. We will start by installing the `mtools` package on Ubuntu 22.04, then delve into the various commands and options available within `mtools`. Finally, we will learn how to manage floppy disk images using `mtools`.

The `mtools` package needs to be installed on the system before it can be used. This lab provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the package and then demonstrates the practical usage of `mtools` commands for file and directory operations on MS-DOS disks.
