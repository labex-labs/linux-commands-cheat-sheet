# Understand the Purpose of the readlink Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `readlink` command in Linux. The `readlink` command is used to display the value of a symbolic link. It is a useful tool for resolving the actual path of a symbolic link, which can be helpful when working with files and directories.

To begin, let's create a symbolic link in the `~/project` directory:

```bash
cd ~/project
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 python_link
```

Now, let's use the `readlink` command to display the value of the symbolic link:

```bash
readlink python_link
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/python3
```

As you can see, the `readlink` command displays the actual path that the symbolic link `python_link` points to, which is `/usr/bin/python3`.

The `readlink` command can be particularly useful when you need to know the real path of a file or directory that is referenced by a symbolic link. This can be helpful when working with scripts or applications that rely on specific file paths.
