# Explore the Syntax and Options of the readlink Command

In this step, you will explore the syntax and available options of the `readlink` command.

The basic syntax of the `readlink` command is:

```bash
readlink [options] file
```

Here are some common options for the `readlink` command:

- `-f`: Follows all symbolic links and returns the final target of the link.
- `-e`: Exits with an error if the file does not exist or is not a symbolic link.
- `-n`: Omits the trailing newline character from the output.
- `-m`: Prints the canonical path, handling both symbolic and hard links.

Let's try out some of these options:

```bash
# Follow the symbolic link and print the final target
readlink -f python_link

# Print the canonical path, handling both symbolic and hard links
readlink -m python_link

# Omit the trailing newline character
readlink -n python_link
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/python3
```

As you can see, the `readlink` command provides various options to customize the output and behavior when working with symbolic links.
