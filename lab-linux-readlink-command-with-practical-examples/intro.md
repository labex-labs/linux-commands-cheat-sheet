# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `readlink` command and how to use it to work with symbolic links. The lab covers the purpose of the `readlink` command, its syntax and available options, and provides practical examples of resolving symbolic links. This knowledge can be helpful when working with files and directories that are referenced by symbolic links, as the `readlink` command allows you to determine the actual path of the target. The content of this lab is focused on the basic file and directory operations in Linux.
