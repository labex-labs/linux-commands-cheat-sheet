# Introduction to the uuto Command

In this step, we will explore the `uuto` command, which is a utility in Linux used for securely sending files between remote systems. The `uuto` command is part of the `uucp` (Unix-to-Unix Copy) suite of tools, which provide a way to transfer files and execute remote commands over a network.

The `uuto` command is designed to work with the `uux` command, which allows users to execute remote commands on other systems. Together, these tools can be used to create a secure and reliable file transfer system between Linux machines.

Let's start by understanding the basic syntax of the `uuto` command:

```
uuto [options] source_file destination_user@remote_host
```

The `source_file` is the file you want to send, and the `destination_user@remote_host` is the recipient's username and the remote system's hostname or IP address.

Some common options for the `uuto` command include:

- `-m`: Send a notification email to the sender when the file transfer is complete.
- `-n`: Do not send a notification email.
- `-r`: Remove the source file after a successful transfer.

Now, let's try a simple example. Suppose we want to send a file named `example.txt` from the current directory to a remote user named `remote_user` on a system with the hostname `remote_host`.

```
uuto example.txt remote_user@remote_host
```

Example output:

```
sending file example.txt to remote_user@remote_host ...
```

In this example, the `uuto` command will initiate the file transfer to the remote system. The actual transfer process may take some time, depending on the file size and network conditions.
