# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `uuto` command, a utility in Linux used for securely sending files between remote systems. We explored the basic syntax of the `uuto` command, including the options to send notification emails and remove the source file after a successful transfer. We also practiced sending a sample file named `example.txt` from the current directory to a remote user on a remote system. Finally, we learned how to receive files using the `uuto` command on the remote system.
