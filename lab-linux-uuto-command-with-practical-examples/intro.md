# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `uuto` command, which is a utility used for securely sending files between remote systems. The `uuto` command is part of the `uucp` (Unix-to-Unix Copy) suite of tools, providing a way to transfer files and execute remote commands over a network. We will learn how to use the `uuto` command to send and receive files, as well as understand its basic syntax and common options.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Introduction to the `uuto` command
2. Sending files using the `uuto` command
3. Receiving files with the `uuto` command
