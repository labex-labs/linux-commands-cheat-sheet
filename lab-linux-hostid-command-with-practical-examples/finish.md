# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose of the `hostid` command in Linux and how to retrieve the unique host identifier. The `hostid` command is used to display the numeric identifier of the current host, which is a 32-bit hexadecimal value generated during system installation or configuration. This unique identifier can be useful for licensing and software activation, system identification, and scripting/automation. We also learned how to verify the availability of the `hostid` command and how to retrieve the unique host identifier using the command.
