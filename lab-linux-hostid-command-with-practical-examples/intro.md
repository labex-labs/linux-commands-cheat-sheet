# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `hostid` command and its practical applications. The `hostid` command is used to display the unique numeric identifier of the current host, which is often used for licensing and system-specific purposes. We will learn how to retrieve the `hostid` value and understand its practical use cases, such as in software licensing and system identification. This lab will provide a comprehensive understanding of the `hostid` command and its role in system management.
