# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the smbclient package on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. smbclient is a command-line tool used to access and interact with Windows file shares. We first updated the package index and then installed the smbclient package using the apt-get command. The installation process also included the installation of the libsmbclient package, which is a dependency for smbclient.

After installing smbclient, we will learn how to connect to a Windows share using the smbclient command and list the files and directories on the share.
