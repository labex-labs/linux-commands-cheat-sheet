# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux smbclient command and its practical applications. smbclient is a command-line tool used to access and interact with Windows file shares. We will start by installing smbclient on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, and then demonstrate how to connect to a Windows share, as well as list the files and directories within it.

The smbclient package is not installed by default on Ubuntu 22.04, so we will need to install it first. Once installed, we can use smbclient to connect to a Windows share and perform various operations, such as listing the contents of the share.
