# Summary

In this lab, we explored the concept of font cache management in Linux systems. We learned that the font cache is a mechanism used by the system to improve the performance of font rendering by storing font information in memory. We checked the current status of the font cache on our system using the `fc-cache` command, and then added a new font to the system and updated the font cache. We understood that the font cache is an important part of the font rendering system in Linux, as it helps improve performance by reducing the time required to load and process font information.
