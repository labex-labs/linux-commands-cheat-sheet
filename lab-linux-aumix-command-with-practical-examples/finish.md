# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the aumix package on Ubuntu 22.04, which provides a command-line tool to adjust various audio settings. We then explored how to use aumix to adjust the master volume level and mute or unmute audio channels. These steps allow users to easily control their system's audio without the need for a graphical interface.
