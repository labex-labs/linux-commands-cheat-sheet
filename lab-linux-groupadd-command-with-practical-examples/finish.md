# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a new group using the `groupadd` command, add users to a group using the `usermod` command, and modify group properties. You created a new group named "developers", added a user named "john" to the "developers" group, and then created a new group named "finance". This hands-on experience with group management in a Linux environment will be valuable for system administration tasks.
