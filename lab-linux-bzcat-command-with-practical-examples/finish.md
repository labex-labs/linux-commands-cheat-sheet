# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `bzcat` command in Linux. The `bzcat` command allows you to decompress Bzip2-compressed files without extracting them to a file, which can be particularly helpful when dealing with large compressed files. You also learned how to use the `bzcat` command to decompress Gzipped files. Finally, you explored how to combine the `bzcat` command with other Linux commands to perform various tasks.

The key takeaways from this lab are the ability to view the contents of compressed files without extracting them, which can save disk space and simplify your workflow. The `bzcat` command provides a convenient way to access the contents of Bzip2 and Gzipped files directly, without the need for additional extraction steps.
