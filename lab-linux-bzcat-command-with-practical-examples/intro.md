# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `bzcat` command in Linux to decompress Bzip2-compressed files and Gzipped files without extracting them to disk. The `bzcat` command is a useful utility for viewing the contents of compressed files, especially when dealing with large files, as it allows you to access the contents without consuming additional disk space. You will also learn how to combine the `bzcat` command with other Linux commands to perform more advanced tasks.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the purpose of the `bzcat` command and how it can be used to view the contents of Bzip2-compressed files.
2. Demonstrate how to use the `bzcat` command to decompress Gzipped files.
3. Explore combining the `bzcat` command with other Linux commands to perform more complex operations.
