# Summary

In this lab, we first learned how to install the unrar package on an Ubuntu 22.04 system, which is a command-line tool for extracting files from RAR archives. We then explored how to extract a single RAR file using the unrar command, as well as how to extract a multi-part RAR archive. These steps provide practical examples of working with RAR files in a Linux environment.
