# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and basic syntax of the `gzip` command in Linux, which is a widely used tool for compressing and decompressing files. We explored how to compress and decompress files using `gzip`, including the common options such as `-d` for decompression, `-r` for recursive compression/decompression, `-k` for keeping the original file, and `-v` for verbose output. We also saw examples of the compression and decompression process, including the output that shows the compression ratio.
