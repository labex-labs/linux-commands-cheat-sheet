# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `depmod` command in Linux to analyze the dependency tree of kernel modules. The `depmod` command is used to generate a dependency file that contains information about the dependencies between kernel modules, which is crucial for ensuring that the required modules are loaded correctly. You will start by understanding the purpose of the `depmod` command, then explore the dependency tree of kernel modules, and finally, learn how to troubleshoot module dependencies using `depmod`. This lab will provide you with practical examples and insights into managing kernel modules and their dependencies in a Linux system.
