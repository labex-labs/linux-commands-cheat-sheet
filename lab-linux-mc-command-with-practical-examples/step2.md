# Explore the Midnight Commander Interface

In this step, we will explore the Midnight Commander (mc) interface and familiarize ourselves with its key features.

First, start the Midnight Commander by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mc
```

This will launch the Midnight Commander interface, which is divided into two main panels. The left panel displays the contents of the current directory, and the right panel displays the contents of the previously visited directory.

At the top of the interface, you'll see the menu bar, which provides access to various commands and functions. You can navigate through the menu options using the arrow keys and press Enter to select an option.

Below the menu bar, you'll see the command line, which displays the current working directory and allows you to enter commands.

The main area of the interface is divided into two panels, as mentioned earlier. You can navigate between the panels using the Tab key. Within each panel, you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor and select files or directories.
