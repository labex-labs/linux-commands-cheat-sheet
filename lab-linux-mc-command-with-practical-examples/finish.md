# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the Midnight Commander (mc) file manager on Ubuntu 22.04. We explored the Midnight Commander interface and performed various file and directory operations using this powerful tool. The installation process involved updating the package index and installing the mc package. We then familiarized ourselves with the Midnight Commander's user interface and utilized its features to manage files and directories, such as navigating, copying, moving, and deleting files and folders.
