# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `pstree` command, which is a useful tool for visualizing the process hierarchy on a Linux system. The `pstree` command displays a tree-like representation of the running processes, showing the parent-child relationships between them. This can be helpful for understanding the structure and dependencies of your system's processes. We will start by understanding the `pstree` command, then explore the process hierarchy using `pstree`, and finally learn how to filter and customize the `pstree` output.
