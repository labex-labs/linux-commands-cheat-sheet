# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `pstree` command, which is a useful tool for visualizing the process hierarchy on a Linux system. We explored how to use `pstree` to understand the parent-child relationships between running processes, and how to filter and customize the output to focus on specific processes or process groups.

The lab covered the basics of the `pstree` command, including how to run it and interpret the tree-like output. We also learned how to use various options to filter the output, such as showing only specific processes or hiding certain process groups. By the end of the lab, we had a better understanding of how to use `pstree` to effectively analyze the process structure on a Linux system.
