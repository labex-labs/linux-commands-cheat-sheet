# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `zcat` command in Linux. The `zcat` command allows you to view the contents of a gzipped file without having to extract it first, which can be particularly helpful when working with large files or when you want to inspect the contents of a file without taking up additional disk space. You also learned how to use the `zcat` command to decompress a gzipped file and how to combine it with other Linux commands to perform various tasks, such as searching the contents of a compressed file or piping the output to another command.
