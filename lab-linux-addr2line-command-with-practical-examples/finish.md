# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the addr2line command in Linux, which is used to translate addresses into file names and line numbers. This is particularly useful when working with debugging information, such as stack traces or core dumps, to determine the source code location corresponding to a particular address. You also explored the basic syntax and options of the addr2line command, including how to specify the executable file containing the debugging information and how to use various options to customize the command's behavior.
