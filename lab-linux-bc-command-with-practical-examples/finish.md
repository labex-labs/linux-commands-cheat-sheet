# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the powerful `bc` command-line calculator tool in Linux. We started by introducing the `bc` command, checking if it's installed, and entering the interactive mode. We then explored basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced calculations using parentheses. Finally, we delved into the advanced capabilities of `bc`, including the use of functions and variables for complex mathematical operations.
