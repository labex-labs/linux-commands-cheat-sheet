# Basic Arithmetic Operations with bc

In this step, we will explore the basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using the `bc` command.

First, let's enter the `bc` interactive mode:

```
bc
```

Now, let's try some basic arithmetic operations:

```
10 + 5
```

Example output:

```
15
```

```
20 - 8
```

Example output:

```
12
```

```
4 * 6
```

Example output:

```
24
```

```
18 / 3
```

Example output:

```
6
```

You can also use parentheses to perform more complex calculations:

```
(10 + 5) * 3
```

Example output:

```
45
```

To exit the `bc` interactive mode, simply type `quit` and press Enter.
