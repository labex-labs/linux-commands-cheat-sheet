# Summary

In this lab, we explored the fundamental concepts of file permissions in the Linux operating system. We learned that each file and directory has three main permission categories: owner, group, and others, and each category has three permission types: read, write, and execute. We also discovered how to view the permissions of a file or directory using the `ls -l` and `stat` commands. Finally, we covered how to change file permissions using the `chmod` command, both for individual files and directories, as well as recursively for all files and subdirectories within a directory.
