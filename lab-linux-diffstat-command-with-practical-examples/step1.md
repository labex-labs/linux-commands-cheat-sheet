# Understand the Purpose and Functionality of the diffstat Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and functionality of the `diffstat` command in Linux. The `diffstat` command is a utility that summarizes the changes made to a set of files, typically used to analyze the output of the `diff` command.

The `diffstat` command reads the output of the `diff` command and produces a histogram-like summary of the insertions, deletions, and modifications in the files. This can be useful when reviewing large diffs, as it provides a high-level overview of the changes made.

Let's start by running the `diffstat` command on a simple example:

```bash
$ diff file1.txt file2.txt | diffstat
 file1.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

In this example, the `diffstat` command is used to analyze the output of the `diff` command, which compares the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. The output of `diffstat` shows that one file was changed, with one insertion and one deletion.

The `diffstat` command can also be used to analyze the output of Git diffs. For example, to see a summary of the changes in the last Git commit, you can run:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | diffstat
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

This command compares the current commit with the previous commit and displays a summary of the changes using `diffstat`.

The `diffstat` command provides several options to customize the output, such as controlling the width of the histogram, the maximum number of files to display, and the order of the files. You can explore these options by running `man diffstat` to learn more.
