# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and functionality of the diffstat command in Linux. The diffstat command is a utility that summarizes the changes made to a set of files, typically used to analyze the output of the diff command. It can provide a high-level overview of the insertions, deletions, and modifications in the files, which can be useful when reviewing large diffs.

Next, you explored the basic usage of the diffstat command, including how to customize its output by controlling the width of the histogram, the maximum number of files to display, and the order of the files. You also learned how to use diffstat to analyze the output of Git diffs, which can be helpful when reviewing changes made in Git repositories.
