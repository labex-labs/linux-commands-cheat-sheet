# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the apachectl command, which is a command-line tool used to control the Apache web server. We explored the different options available with the apachectl command, including starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of the Apache web server. We then learned how to start, stop, and restart the Apache web server using the apachectl command, and how to check the status of the Apache web server.
