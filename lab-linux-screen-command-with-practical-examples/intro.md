# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the powerful `screen` command in Linux. The `screen` command allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions, which is particularly useful for long-running processes, remote sessions, or when you need to switch between different tasks without losing your work. You will start by installing the `screen` package, then create and navigate between multiple screen sessions. Finally, you will learn how to detach and reattach to screen sessions, ensuring your work is preserved even if you need to disconnect from the terminal.
