# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the powerful `screen` command, which allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions. You installed the `screen` package and created a new screen session, detached from it, and then reattached to the running session. Additionally, you learned how to create and navigate between multiple screen sessions, which is particularly useful for long-running processes or when you need to switch between different tasks without losing your work.

You also discovered how to list all the currently running screen sessions and switch between them using the `screen -r` command. These skills will help you become more efficient and productive when working in a terminal environment.
