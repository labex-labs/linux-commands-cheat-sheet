# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose of the `ifdown` command in Linux, which is used to disable or bring down a network interface. The `ifdown` command is typically used to disable a specific network interface, bring down a network interface, or prepare for network configuration changes. We also learned how to use the `ifdown` command to disable the `eth0` network interface and verify its status using the `ip link show` command.
