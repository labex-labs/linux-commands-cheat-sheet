# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) command in Linux, understanding its various options and commands such as `connect`, `put`, `get`, and `quit`. We learned how to use the `get` and `put` commands to download and upload files from and to a tftp server. Next, we configured a tftp server on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, installed the necessary packages, and set up the server to allow file transfers. Finally, we demonstrated how to transfer files using the tftp client, both uploading and downloading files between the client and the server.
