# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `tftp` (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) command and learn how to configure a `tftp` server to transfer files between a client and a server. We will start by understanding the basic usage of the `tftp` command, including its various options and commands. Then, we will proceed to set up a `tftp` server and use it to transfer files. This lab aims to provide a practical understanding of the `tftp` protocol and its application in network file transfers.
