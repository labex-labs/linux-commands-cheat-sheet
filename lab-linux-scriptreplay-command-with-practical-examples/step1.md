# Introduction to the scriptreplay Command

In this step, you will learn about the `scriptreplay` command in Linux, which allows you to replay previously recorded terminal sessions. The `scriptreplay` command works in conjunction with the `script` command, which is used to record terminal sessions.

First, let's check if the `script` command is installed on your system:

```bash
which script
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/script
```

If the `script` command is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y script
```

Now, let's create a sample terminal session recording using the `script` command:

```bash
script recording.log
```

This will start recording your terminal session, and all the commands you execute will be saved to the `recording.log` file.

```
Script started, output file is recording.log
```

You can now execute some commands in your terminal, and they will be recorded in the `recording.log` file.

```bash
echo "Hello, world!"
ls -l
```

To stop the recording, type `exit`:

```
exit
Script done, output file is recording.log
```

Now, you can replay the recorded session using the `scriptreplay` command:

```bash
scriptreplay recording.log
```

This will replay the recorded terminal session, and you will see the commands being executed as they were recorded.

Example output:

```
Script started on 2023-04-24 12:34:56
echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 labex labex 42 Apr 24 12:34 recording.log
Script done on 2023-04-24 12:34:57
```

The `scriptreplay` command can be a useful tool for troubleshooting, training, or sharing terminal sessions with others.
