# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `scriptreplay` command and how to use it to replay previously recorded terminal sessions. The lab covers the introduction to the `scriptreplay` command, recording terminal sessions with the `script` command, and replaying the recorded sessions using `scriptreplay`. The `script` command may need to be installed on your system, and the `scriptreplay` command can be a useful tool for troubleshooting, training, or sharing terminal sessions with others.
