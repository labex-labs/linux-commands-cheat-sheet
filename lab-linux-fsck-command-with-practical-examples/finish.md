# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose and importance of the `fsck` (file system check) command in Linux. The `fsck` command is a critical tool used to check and repair file system inconsistencies, ensuring the integrity and reliability of your data. We also learned how to use the `fsck` command to check the integrity of a file system, and how to repair issues by introducing an error to the file system and running `fsck` to detect and fix the problem.
