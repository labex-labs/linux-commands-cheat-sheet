# Understand the Purpose of the exit Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and usage of the `exit` command in Linux. The `exit` command is used to terminate a shell script or a shell session, and it can also be used to return a specific exit status.

The `exit` command is commonly used in shell scripts to indicate the success or failure of the script. By using different exit codes, you can provide information about the script's execution status to the parent process or the system.

Let's start by understanding the basic usage of the `exit` command.

```bash
exit
```

Example output:

```
$ exit
exit
```

In the example above, the `exit` command is used without any arguments, which means the script or shell session will exit with the current exit status. The default exit status is 0, which indicates a successful execution.

You can also provide an exit code as an argument to the `exit` command. This allows you to specify a specific exit status for the script or shell session.

```bash
exit 1
```

Example output:

```
$ exit 1
exit
```

In this case, the script or shell session will exit with an exit status of 1, which typically indicates an error or failure.

The `exit` command can be used at any point in a shell script or shell session to terminate the execution. It's commonly used at the end of a script to indicate the overall success or failure of the script.
