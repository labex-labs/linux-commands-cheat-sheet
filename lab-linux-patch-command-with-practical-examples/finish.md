# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `patch` command in Linux, which is used to apply differences between files to an original file, allowing you to update or modify the file with changes made in a separate file. You also learned how to apply a patch to a file using the `patch` command, by first creating a sample file, modifying it, generating a patch file, and then applying the patch to the original file. Finally, you learned how to revert a patch using the `-R` option of the `patch` command.
