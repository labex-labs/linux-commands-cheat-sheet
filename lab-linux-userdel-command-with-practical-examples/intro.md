# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `userdel` command in Linux to delete user accounts, including removing their home directory and mail spool. We will cover the basic usage of the `userdel` command, how to delete a user account, and how to remove the user's home directory and mail spool. This lab focuses on user and permission management, a crucial aspect of Linux system administration.

The `userdel` command is used to remove user accounts from the system. By default, it does not remove the user's home directory and mail spool, but you can use the `-r` option to do so. We will demonstrate the usage of the `userdel` command with practical examples.
