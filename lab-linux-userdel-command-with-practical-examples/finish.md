# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `userdel` command in Linux, which is used to delete user accounts from the system. We explored the basic usage of the `userdel` command, including the common options such as `-r` to remove the user's home directory and mail spool, and `-f` to force the removal of the user account even if the user is currently logged in. We then practiced deleting a user account and removing the user's home directory and mail spool. The key learning points from this lab are understanding the `userdel` command and its options, and how to effectively delete user accounts and their associated files.
