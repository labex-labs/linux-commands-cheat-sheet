# Remove Packages and Clean the System with apt-get

In this step, you will learn how to remove packages and clean up your system using the `apt-get` command.

First, let's remove the `tree` package that we installed in the previous step:

```
sudo apt-get remove tree
Example output:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  tree
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 152 kB of disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
```

In the example above, we used the `remove` operation to uninstall the `tree` package.

Next, let's clean up the downloaded package files to free up disk space:

```
sudo apt-get clean
Example output:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
```

The `clean` operation removes the downloaded package files from the local repository, freeing up disk space on your system.

Finally, let's remove any packages that are no longer needed, using the `autoremove` operation:

```
sudo apt-get autoremove
Example output:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  linux-headers-5.15.0-46 linux-headers-5.15.0-46-generic linux-image-5.15.0-46-generic
  linux-modules-5.15.0-46-generic linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-46-generic
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 5 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 321 MB of disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
```

The `autoremove` operation identifies and removes any packages that were installed automatically as dependencies and are no longer needed.
