# Customize joe Text Editor Settings

In this step, we will learn how to customize the settings of the joe text editor.

First, let's create a new file named `~/.joerc` to store our custom settings:

```bash
touch ~/.joerc
```

Now, open the `~/.joerc` file using the joe editor:

```bash
joe ~/.joerc
```

In the `~/.joerc` file, you can add various configuration options to customize the behavior of the joe editor. Here are some common settings you can try:

```
# Set the tab size to 4 spaces
set tabsize 4

# Enable syntax highlighting
set syntax on

# Set the default file encoding to UTF-8
set fileencoding utf8

# Enable line numbers
set linenumbers on

# Set the color scheme to dark
colorscheme dark
```

Save and exit the `~/.joerc` file.

Now, let's open a new file and see the effect of our custom settings:

```bash
joe example.cfg
```

You should see the file opened with the customized settings, such as 4-space tabs, syntax highlighting, and line numbers.

Example output:

```
# This is an example configuration file
# The joe text editor settings have been customized

    # Set the tab size to 4 spaces
    set tabsize 4

    # Enable syntax highlighting
    set syntax on

    # Set the default file encoding to UTF-8
    set fileencoding utf8

    # Enable line numbers
    set linenumbers on

    # Set the color scheme to dark
    colorscheme dark
```
