# Summary

In this lab, you first explored the purpose and functionality of the `ipcs` command in Linux, which allows you to view information about Inter-Process Communication (IPC) resources on your system, such as shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. You then learned about the different options and flags available with the `ipcs` command, which can be used to customize the output and gather specific information about IPC resources. Finally, you discussed how to analyze IPC resources and identify potential issues using the `ipcs` command.
