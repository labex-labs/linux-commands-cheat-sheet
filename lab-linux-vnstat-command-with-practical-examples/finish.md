# Summary

In this lab, we first installed the vnstat network monitoring tool on the Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. We updated the package index, installed the vnstat package, and verified the installation. Then, we used the vnstat command to monitor network traffic on the system, checking the available network interfaces and starting the vnstat daemon to monitor the eth0 interface. Finally, we explored generating reports and visualizing network data with vnstat, using various commands to display detailed information about network usage and traffic patterns.
