# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux vnstat command, a powerful network monitoring tool, and learn how to install it on Ubuntu 22.04, monitor network traffic, and generate reports to visualize the data. We will start by installing vnstat, then use it to monitor network usage, and finally, generate reports to analyze the collected data. This lab is designed to provide practical examples and insights into network traffic analysis using the vnstat command.
