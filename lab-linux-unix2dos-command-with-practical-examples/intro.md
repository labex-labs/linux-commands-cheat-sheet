# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `unix2dos` command to convert text files from the Unix/Linux format to the DOS/Windows format. The `unix2dos` command is used to handle the differences in newline characters between these two operating systems. You will start by creating a sample text file in the Unix format, then use the `unix2dos` command to convert it to the DOS format. Additionally, you will learn how to convert multiple files at once, which can be useful when working with a large number of text files.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Introduction to the `unix2dos` command
2. Converting text files from Unix to DOS format
3. Handling newline characters in text files
