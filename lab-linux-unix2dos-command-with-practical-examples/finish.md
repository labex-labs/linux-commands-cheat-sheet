# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `unix2dos` command, which is used to convert text files from the Unix/Linux format to the DOS/Windows format. The main difference between these two formats is the way they handle newline characters, with Unix using a single `LF` (Line Feed) character and Windows/DOS using a combination of `CR` (Carriage Return) and `LF` characters. You created sample text files in the Unix format and used the `unix2dos` command to convert them to the DOS format, observing the addition of the `^M` character at the end of each line. You also learned how to convert multiple files at once using the `unix2dos *.txt` command.

Additionally, you explored the process of converting text files from Unix to DOS format, creating more sample files and using the `unix2dos` command to convert them all in the current directory.
