# Introduction to unix2dos Command

In this step, you will learn about the `unix2dos` command, which is used to convert text files from the Unix/Linux format to the DOS/Windows format. The main difference between these two formats is the way they handle newline characters.

In Unix-like systems, the newline character is represented by a single `LF` (Line Feed) character, while in Windows/DOS, the newline is represented by a combination of `CR` (Carriage Return) and `LF` characters.

Let's start by creating a sample text file in the Unix format:

```bash
echo "This is a sample text file." > sample_unix.txt
```

Example output:

```
This is a sample text file.
```

Now, let's use the `unix2dos` command to convert the file from Unix to DOS format:

```bash
unix2dos sample_unix.txt
```

Example output:

```
unix2dos: converting file sample_unix.txt to DOS format ...
```

You can now check the contents of the converted file:

```bash
cat sample_unix.txt
```

Example output:

```
This is a sample text file.^M
```

Notice the `^M` character at the end of the line, which represents the added `CR` (Carriage Return) character.

The `unix2dos` command can also be used to convert multiple files at once:

```bash
unix2dos *.txt
```

This will convert all text files in the current directory from Unix to DOS format.
