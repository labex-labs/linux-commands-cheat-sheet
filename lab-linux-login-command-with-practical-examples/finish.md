# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `login` command, which is used to log in to the system. We learned the basic syntax of the `login` command and how to log in as a regular user by simply typing `login` and entering the username and password when prompted. We also discussed logging in as the root user, which requires special privileges and should be done with caution. The lab provided practical examples and highlighted the importance of the `login` command for system administrators and users to access their accounts and perform various tasks.
