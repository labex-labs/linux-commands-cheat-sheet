# Interpret tload Output and Identify Performance Issues

In this final step, we will learn how to interpret the output of the `tload` command and identify potential performance issues on your system.

The `tload` command displays the system load average, which is a measure of the number of processes that are waiting to be executed by the CPU. The load average is calculated as the average number of processes that are running or waiting to run over a specific time period, typically 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

To interpret the `tload` output, look at the following values:

- The current load average: This is displayed at the top of the graph, and represents the average number of processes that are waiting to be executed by the CPU over the past minute.
- The 5-minute load average: This is the average number of processes waiting to be executed over the past 5 minutes.
- The 15-minute load average: This is the average number of processes waiting to be executed over the past 15 minutes.

Generally, a load average of 1.0 or less indicates that your system is not experiencing any performance issues. A load average of 2.0 or higher may indicate that your system is experiencing performance issues and may need to be investigated further.

To identify potential performance issues, you can look for the following in the `tload` output:

- Sudden spikes in the load average: This may indicate that a specific process or application is consuming a lot of CPU resources.
- Consistently high load averages: This may indicate that your system is overloaded and needs more resources (e.g., more CPU cores, more memory, etc.).
- Differences between the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages: If the 1-minute load average is significantly higher than the 5-minute and 15-minute load averages, this may indicate a temporary spike in CPU usage.

By monitoring the `tload` output and identifying any performance issues, you can take steps to optimize your system's performance and ensure that it is running efficiently.
