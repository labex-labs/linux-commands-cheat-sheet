# Summary

In this lab, we first learned how to understand the `tload` command, which displays the system load average. We then explored how to monitor the system load average using `tload` and interpret the output to identify potential performance issues. The key learnings include understanding the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages, and looking for sudden spikes or consistently high load averages that may indicate performance problems. By monitoring the `tload` output, system administrators can take appropriate actions to optimize system performance.
