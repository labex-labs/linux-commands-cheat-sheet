# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `mkfs` command in Linux, which is used to create file systems on partitions or storage devices. We explored the available file system types on the system and how to use the `mkfs` command to create an ext4 file system on a partition. We also learned how to create a file system on a USB drive using the `mkfs` command.

The lab provided a practical understanding of the `mkfs` command and its usage in formatting storage media with various file system types. This knowledge can be applied to efficiently manage and maintain file systems on Linux systems.
