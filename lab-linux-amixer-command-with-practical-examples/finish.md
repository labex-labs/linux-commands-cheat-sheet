# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `amixer` command, which is a command-line tool used to control sound card mixer settings in Linux. You started by checking the current sound card mixer settings using the `amixer` command and then learned how to adjust the volume of the 'Master' control. Additionally, you explored how to control specific sound channels using `amixer`.

You discovered that the `amixer` command allows you to adjust the volume, balance, and other settings of your sound card. You learned how to set the master volume to a specific level, such as 50%, using the `amixer set` command. This provides you with the ability to fine-tune the audio output on your Linux system.
