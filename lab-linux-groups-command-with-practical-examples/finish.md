# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the Linux `groups` command, which allows us to view the groups a user belongs to, create new groups, and add or remove users from groups. We then explored how to create and manage user groups using the `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel` commands. Finally, we covered how to assign and remove users from groups using the `usermod` command.

The key learning points from this lab include understanding the purpose and usage of the `groups` command, creating and modifying user groups, and managing user membership within those groups. These skills are essential for effectively administering user access and permissions in a Linux environment.
