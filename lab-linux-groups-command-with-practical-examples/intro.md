# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `groups` command, which is used to manage user groups. We will learn how to view the groups a user belongs to, create new groups, and add or remove users from groups. The lab covers understanding the `groups` command, creating and managing user groups, and assigning and removing users from groups. The commands covered in this lab are commonly used for user and permission management in Linux environments.
