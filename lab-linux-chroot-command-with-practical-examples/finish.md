# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and use cases of the `chroot` command in Linux. We learned that `chroot` is used to change the root directory of a process and its children, allowing the creation of an isolated environment known as a chroot jail. This is particularly useful for security, software testing and development, system maintenance and recovery, as well as containerization. We then demonstrated how to create a chroot environment using Ubuntu 22.04 and manage processes and the file system within it.

Next, we will learn how to manage processes and the file system within the chroot environment, further expanding our understanding of this powerful Linux tool.
