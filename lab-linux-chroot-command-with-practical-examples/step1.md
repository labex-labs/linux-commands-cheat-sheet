# Understand the Purpose and Use Cases of chroot

In this step, we will explore the purpose and use cases of the `chroot` command in Linux. The `chroot` command is used to change the root directory of a process and its children. This allows you to create an isolated environment, known as a chroot jail, where the process can only access files and resources within the specified root directory.

The primary use cases of `chroot` include:

1. **Security**: By isolating a process or application within a chroot environment, you can limit its access to sensitive system files and resources, reducing the potential impact of security vulnerabilities or malicious activities.

2. **Software testing and development**: Developers can use `chroot` to test applications in a controlled environment, ensuring that the software behaves as expected without interfering with the host system.

3. **System maintenance and recovery**: `chroot` can be used to access and repair a damaged file system, such as when the system fails to boot properly. By booting from a live CD/USB and chrooting into the damaged file system, you can perform various recovery tasks.

4. **Containerization**: The `chroot` command is a fundamental building block for container technologies, such as Docker, which use it to create isolated environments for running applications.

Let's start by verifying the current root directory:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```
/home/labex/project
```

As you can see, the current root directory is `/home/labex/project`. Now, let's try changing the root directory using the `chroot` command:

```bash
sudo chroot /
```

This will change the root directory to `/`, effectively creating a new root environment. You can verify this by running the `pwd` command again:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```
/
```

To exit the chroot environment, simply type `exit`:

```bash
exit
```

This will return you to the original root directory.
