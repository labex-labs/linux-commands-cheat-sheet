# Manage Processes and File System within the Chroot Environment

In this step, we will explore how to manage processes and the file system within the chroot environment we created in the previous step.

First, let's enter the chroot environment:

```bash
sudo chroot ~/project/chroot
```

Now, let's try running a simple command inside the chroot environment:

```bash
ls -l /
```

This will list the contents of the root directory (`/`) within the chroot environment.

Next, let's try running a process that interacts with the file system. We'll create a new file inside the chroot environment:

```bash
touch /test_file.txt
```

To verify that the file was created, run:

```bash
ls -l /
```

You should see the `test_file.txt` file listed.

Now, let's try running a process that interacts with the outside world. We'll attempt to ping a remote host:

```bash
ping -c 3 google.com
```

You may notice that the ping command fails, as the chroot environment is isolated from the network outside of the chroot.

To exit the chroot environment, simply type `exit`:

```bash
exit
```

This will return you to the original root directory.
