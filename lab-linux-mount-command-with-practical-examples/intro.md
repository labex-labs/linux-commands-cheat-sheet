# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `mount` command to attach file systems to specific locations in the directory structure. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `mount` command, as well as examples of mounting both local and remote file systems. You will learn how to mount an `ext4` file system on a local device and how to mount a remote file system using NFS (Network File System).

The lab provides a step-by-step guide to help you understand the `mount` command and its practical applications in managing file systems on a Linux system.
