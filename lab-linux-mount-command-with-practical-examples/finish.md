# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose and syntax of the `mount` command in Linux, which is used to attach a file system to a specific location in the directory structure. We practiced mounting a local file system by creating a new mount point directory and using the `mount` command with the appropriate options. We also verified the successful mount operation using the `mount` command. Additionally, we explored mounting a remote file system using NFS, which allows accessing shared directories over the network.
