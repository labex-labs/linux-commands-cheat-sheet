# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a new user account on a Linux system using the `adduser` command. We set a password for the new user and also configured an expiration date for the account using the `chage` command. Additionally, we learned how to add the new user to existing groups on the system.

The key steps covered in this lab include creating a new user account, setting the user's password and expiration date, and adding the user to existing groups. These skills are essential for managing user accounts and permissions on a Linux system.
