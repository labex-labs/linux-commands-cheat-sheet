# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `ftpcount` command and its practical applications. The lab covers the installation of the `ftpcount` command, its usage to count active FTP sessions, and an analysis of the command's output to understand the session details. The `ftpcount` command is a useful tool for monitoring and managing FTP activity on a system.

The lab starts by installing the `ftpcount` command on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. Next, we use `ftpcount` to count the active FTP sessions, which involves setting up an FTP server (using `vsftpd`) and then running the `ftpcount` command to observe the session details. Finally, we analyze the output of `ftpcount` to understand the information it provides about the active FTP sessions.
