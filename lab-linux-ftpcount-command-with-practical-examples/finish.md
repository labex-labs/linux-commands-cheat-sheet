# Summary

In this lab, we first installed the `ftpcount` command on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container by updating the package index and installing the `ftpcount` package. We then used the `ftpcount` command to monitor and count the active FTP sessions on the system. We started an FTP server using the `vsftpd` package and used `ftpcount` to check the active FTP sessions. Finally, we analyzed the `ftpcount` output to understand the details of the FTP sessions.
