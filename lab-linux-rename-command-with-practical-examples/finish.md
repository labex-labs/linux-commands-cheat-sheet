# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the `rename` command in Linux, which is a powerful tool for batch renaming files and directories based on a specified pattern. The basic syntax of the `rename` command is `rename 'expression' files`, where `expression` is a Perl-compatible regular expression that defines the pattern to match and replace. You also saw an example of how to rename all files with the `.txt` extension to `.doc`.

Next, you learned how to use the `rename` command to rename individual files, including adding prefixes or suffixes to the file names. The `rename` command supports Perl-compatible regular expressions, which allows you to perform more complex renaming operations.
