# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `halt` command, which is used to safely shut down the system. We first understood the basic usage of the `halt` command, including how to power off the system after the shutdown process is complete using the `-p` option, and how to force an immediate shutdown using the `-f` option. We then learned how to shut down the system using the `halt` command, ensuring that all running processes are terminated and the file system is properly unmounted before the system powers off.
