# Utilize the tail Command for Monitoring Log Files

In this final step, you will learn how to use the `tail` command to monitor log files, which is one of its most common use cases.

First, let's create a sample log file:

```
$ touch sample.log
$ echo "2023-04-01 10:00:00 - INFO: Application started" >> sample.log
$ echo "2023-04-01 10:00:15 - DEBUG: Processing request" >> sample.log
$ echo "2023-04-01 10:00:30 - ERROR: Database connection failed" >> sample.log
$ echo "2023-04-01 10:01:00 - INFO: Application shutting down" >> sample.log
```

Now, let's use the `tail` command to monitor the log file:

```
$ tail -f sample.log
2023-04-01 10:00:00 - INFO: Application started
2023-04-01 10:00:15 - DEBUG: Processing request
2023-04-01 10:00:30 - ERROR: Database connection failed
2023-04-01 10:01:00 - INFO: Application shutting down
```

The `-f` option tells `tail` to "follow" the file, which means it will continuously display new lines as they are added to the log file.

You can also use the `tail` command to search for specific log entries using the `grep` command:

```
$ tail -n 10 sample.log | grep "ERROR"
2023-04-01 10:00:30 - ERROR: Database connection failed
```

This will display the last 10 lines of the log file and filter for any lines containing the word "ERROR".

The `tail` command is particularly useful for monitoring and troubleshooting live systems, as it allows you to quickly view and search the most recent log entries without having to open the entire log file.
