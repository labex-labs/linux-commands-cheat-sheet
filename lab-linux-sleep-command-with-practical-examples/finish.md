# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `sleep` command in Linux, which is used to pause the execution of a script or command for a specified amount of time. You explored the basic syntax of the `sleep` command and how to use it with different time intervals, such as seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Additionally, you learned how to combine the `sleep` command with other Linux commands to create more complex workflows, such as introducing delays between commands or pausing a script for user input.

The lab provided practical examples to demonstrate the usage of the `sleep` command, which can be a valuable tool in shell scripting and system administration tasks.
