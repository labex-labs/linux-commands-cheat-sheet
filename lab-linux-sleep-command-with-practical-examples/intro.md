# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `sleep` command in Linux, which is used to pause the execution of a script or command for a specified amount of time. You will understand the basic syntax of the `sleep` command, use it with different time intervals, and combine it with other Linux commands to create more complex workflows. The `sleep` command is a useful tool for introducing delays or pauses in your scripts, allowing time for other processes to complete or for the user to read output.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `sleep` command
2. Use the `sleep` command with time intervals
3. Combine `sleep` with other Linux commands
