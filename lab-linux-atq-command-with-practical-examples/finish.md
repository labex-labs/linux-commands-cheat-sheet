# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `atq` command in Linux, which is used to list scheduled jobs or tasks. You started by checking if the `at` package was installed on your system and then used the `atq` command to display a list of currently scheduled jobs. The output showed the job number, scheduled time, and the user who scheduled the job. You also learned how to create sample jobs using the `at` command and then list them using `atq`. Finally, you explored additional options to customize the output of the `atq` command.
