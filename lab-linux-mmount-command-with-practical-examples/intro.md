# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mount` command and its practical applications. The lab aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mounting process in Linux, including the concept of mounting, the syntax and options of the `mount` command, and how to mount file systems using this command.

We will start by understanding the concept of mounting in the Linux operating system, where we will learn how the file system hierarchy is organized and how mounting integrates external file systems into the existing directory structure. Next, we will delve into the syntax and available options of the `mount` command, enabling you to customize the mounting process according to your needs. Finally, we will put this knowledge into practice by demonstrating how to mount file systems using the `mount` command.
