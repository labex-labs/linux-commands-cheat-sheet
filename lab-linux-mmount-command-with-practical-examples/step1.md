# Understand the Concept of Mounting in Linux

In this step, we will explore the concept of mounting in the Linux operating system. Mounting is the process of attaching a file system to a specific location in the Linux directory structure, making the files and directories within that file system accessible to the user.

In Linux, the file system hierarchy is organized in a tree-like structure, with the root directory (`/`) at the top. When you mount a file system, you are essentially integrating it into this existing directory structure, allowing you to access the files and directories within that file system as if they were part of the main file system.

For example, let's say you have an external hard drive that you want to use on your Linux system. You would first need to mount that drive to a specific location in the file system, such as `/mnt/external_drive`. Once mounted, you can navigate to `/mnt/external_drive` and access the files and directories on the external drive.

The `mount` command is the primary tool used to mount file systems in Linux. In the next step, we will explore the syntax and options of the `mount` command in more detail.
