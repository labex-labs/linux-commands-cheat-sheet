# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basic syntax of the `echo` command in Linux, including the use of options like `-n` to suppress the trailing newline and `-e` to enable backslash escapes. You also explored using `echo` to print text to the console, including printing the value of variables and printing multiple lines of text. Finally, you learned how to utilize `echo` for variable substitution and formatting, such as using double quotes to allow variable expansion and employing backslash escapes for formatting.
