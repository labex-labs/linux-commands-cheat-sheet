# Use echo to Print Text to the Console

In this step, you will learn how to use the `echo` command to print text to the console.

The most basic usage of the `echo` command is to print a string or message to the console. You can simply pass the text you want to display as an argument to the `echo` command:

```
echo "This is a message printed to the console."
```

Example output:

```
This is a message printed to the console.
```

You can also use the `echo` command to print the value of a variable. For example:

```
name="John Doe"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Example output:

```
Hello, John Doe!
```

In the above example, the `echo` command prints the value of the `name` variable, which is "John Doe".

Additionally, you can use the `echo` command to print multiple lines of text. You can do this by using the newline character `\n` within the string:

```
echo "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
```

Example output:

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

The `echo` command is a versatile tool for printing text to the console, and it can be used in various ways to suit your needs.
