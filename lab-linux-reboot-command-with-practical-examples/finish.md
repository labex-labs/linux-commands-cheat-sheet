# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the Linux `reboot` command and its various options, such as forcing a reboot, shutting down network interfaces, and halting the processor. We then learned how to immediately reboot the system using the `reboot` command, verifying the current system uptime before executing the command. Finally, we discovered how to schedule a system reboot at a specific time using the `shutdown` command, which provides more control over the reboot process.
