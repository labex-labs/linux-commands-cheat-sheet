# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `lprm` command to remove print jobs from the print queue on a Linux system. You started by introducing the `lprm` command and checking the current print queue using the `lpq` command. You then learned how to remove a specific print job by running the `lprm` command with the job ID. Finally, you discovered how to remove all print jobs from the queue by using the `lprm -` command.

The key learning points from this lab are:

1. The `lprm` command is used to remove print jobs from the print queue.
2. You can remove a specific print job by running `lprm` with the job ID.
3. To remove all print jobs from the queue, you can use the `lprm -` command.
