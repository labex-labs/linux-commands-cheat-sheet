# Understand the Purpose and Functionality of iotop

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and functionality of the iotop command in Linux. iotop is a command-line tool that monitors disk I/O usage in real-time, providing detailed information about the processes that are utilizing the most disk I/O.

To understand the purpose of iotop, let's first explore the importance of monitoring disk I/O in a system. Disk I/O (Input/Output) refers to the transfer of data between the system's memory and storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). Monitoring disk I/O is crucial because it can help identify performance bottlenecks, detect resource-intensive processes, and optimize system performance.

iotop provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: iotop displays the current disk I/O usage in real-time, allowing you to observe the system's performance and identify any issues as they occur.

2. **Process-level Details**: iotop provides detailed information about the processes that are consuming the most disk I/O, including the process ID, user, read and write rates, and the total disk I/O usage.

3. **Sorting and Filtering**: iotop allows you to sort the output by various criteria, such as read or write rates, and filter the results to focus on specific processes or users.

4. **Resource Utilization Insights**: By understanding the disk I/O usage patterns, you can identify resource-intensive processes, optimize disk-related operations, and improve overall system performance.

Let's move on to the next step, where you will learn how to install and configure iotop on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.
