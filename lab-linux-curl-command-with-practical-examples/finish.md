# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the powerful curl command, which is a versatile tool for transferring data using various protocols. We started by exploring the version and capabilities of the curl command installed on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. Then, we used curl to fetch the content of the curl project's homepage, both by displaying the output in the terminal and by saving it to a file. Finally, we discussed how to use curl to download files, which is a common use case for this command.
