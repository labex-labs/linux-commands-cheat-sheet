# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `mcopy` command, a tool for copying files and directories between different file systems, including FAT, NTFS, and Linux file systems. The lab covers understanding the `mcopy` command, copying files and directories using `mcopy`, and exploring advanced `mcopy` options. To use `mcopy`, you will need to have the `mtools` package installed on your system. The lab also notes that the `mtools` package may need to be installed, as it is a collection of utilities for accessing MS-DOS file systems from Unix-like systems.
