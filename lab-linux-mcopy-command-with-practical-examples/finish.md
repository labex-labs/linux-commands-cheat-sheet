# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `mcopy` command, which is a tool used to copy files and directories between different file systems, including FAT, NTFS, and Linux file systems. You started by checking if the `mtools` package, which includes the `mcopy` command, was installed on your system, and then explored the basic usage of the `mcopy` command to copy a file from your local file system to a FAT/VFAT file system. You then learned how to use the `mcopy` command to copy an entire directory and its contents to a FAT/VFAT file system.
