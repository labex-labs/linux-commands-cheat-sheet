# Analyzing CPU, Memory, and Disk I/O with vmstat

In this step, you will learn how to analyze the CPU, memory, and disk I/O metrics provided by the vmstat command to identify potential performance issues in your system.

Let's start by analyzing the CPU utilization:

```
$ vmstat 2 5
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 0  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0  367  688  0  0 100  0  0
 0  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0  369  682  0  0 100  0  0
 0  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0  373  696  0  0 100  0  0
 0  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0  367  688  0  0 100  0  0
 0  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0  367  688  0  0 100  0  0
```

In the "cpu" section, you can see that the CPU is mostly idle (100%), which indicates that the system is not under heavy load.

Next, let's analyze the memory usage:

```
$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0    0    0  0  0 100  0  0
```

The "memory" section shows that the system has a large amount of free memory (1,877,028 kB) and a significant amount of cached memory (1,359,812 kB). This indicates that the system has enough memory resources available and is not experiencing any memory-related performance issues.

Finally, let's analyze the disk I/O:

```
$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0 1877028  16308 1359812    0    0     0     0    0    0  0  0 100  0  0
```

The "io" section shows that there are no blocks being read from or written to disk (`bi` and `bo` are both 0). This suggests that the system is not experiencing any significant disk I/O activity.

By analyzing the CPU, memory, and disk I/O metrics provided by the vmstat command, you can identify potential performance bottlenecks in your system and take appropriate actions to optimize its performance.
