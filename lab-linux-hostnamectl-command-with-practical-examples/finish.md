# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `hostnamectl` command, a Linux tool used to display and manage the system hostname. We learned how to view the static hostname, transient hostname, and other system information provided by `hostnamectl`. We also discovered how to temporarily and permanently change the system hostname using this command. The key takeaways from this lab are the ability to efficiently retrieve and modify the hostname settings on a Linux system through the `hostnamectl` utility.
