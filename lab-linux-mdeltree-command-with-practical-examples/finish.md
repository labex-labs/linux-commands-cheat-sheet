# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `mdeltree` command in Linux, a powerful tool for recursively removing directories and handling symbolic links and permissions. We learned the basic usage of the `mdeltree` command, including its various options such as verbose mode, force mode, following symbolic links, and preserving permissions. We then practiced using the `mdeltree` command to recursively remove directories and their contents, ensuring a controlled and secure deletion process.
