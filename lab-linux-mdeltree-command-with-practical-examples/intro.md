# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mdeltree` command, which is a powerful tool for recursively removing directories and handling symbolic links and permissions. The lab covers the basic usage of the `mdeltree` command, how to remove directories recursively, and how to handle symbolic links and permissions during the deletion process. The `mdeltree` command provides additional features and safeguards compared to the standard `rm -rf` command, ensuring a more controlled and secure directory deletion process.
