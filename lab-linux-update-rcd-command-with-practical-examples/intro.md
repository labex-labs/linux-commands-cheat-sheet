# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `update-rc.d` command in Linux to manage the automatic startup of services at system boot. You will understand the purpose of the `update-rc.d` command, configure services to start automatically at boot, and manage service startup priorities. The lab covers practical examples and the basic syntax of the `update-rc.d` command, which is particularly useful when you need to ensure that a service starts automatically when the system boots up or when you want to change the order in which services are started.
