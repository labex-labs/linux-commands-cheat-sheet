# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `cksum` command in Linux, which is used to calculate the checksum of a file. The checksum is a unique numerical value that represents the contents of a file and can be used to verify the integrity of the file. You learned how to calculate the checksum of a single file as well as multiple files at once, and how to interpret the output of the `cksum` command. Additionally, you learned how to use the `cksum` command to verify the integrity of a file by comparing its checksum to the original checksum.
