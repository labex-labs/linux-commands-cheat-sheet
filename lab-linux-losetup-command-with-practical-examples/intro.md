# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `losetup` command, which is a utility used to associate a regular file or block device with a loopback device. Loopback devices are virtual block devices that allow you to treat a file as if it were a physical block device. We will learn how to create a loopback device, attach a file to it, and detach the loopback device. This lab covers various use cases of the `losetup` command, which is a valuable tool for disk and file system management in Linux.
