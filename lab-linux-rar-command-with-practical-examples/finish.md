# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the rar package on Ubuntu 22.04, create and extract rar archives, and manage rar archives with advanced options. We started by updating the package index and installing the rar package, which provides the rar command for working with RAR archives. Then, we learned how to create new rar archives, add files to existing archives, and extract the contents of rar archives. Finally, we explored advanced rar options, such as setting passwords, splitting archives, and testing the integrity of rar files.
