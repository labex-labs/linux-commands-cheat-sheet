# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to install Linux packages using the `apt-get` command, which is a powerful tool for managing packages on Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. You started by updating the package lists to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. Then, you installed the `tree` package, which is a command-line tool that displays the directory structure in a tree-like format.

You also learned how to install Linux packages using the `apt` command, which is a newer and more user-friendly package management tool compared to `apt-get`. Additionally, you explored the use of the Snap package manager, which provides a different approach to installing and managing software on Linux systems.
