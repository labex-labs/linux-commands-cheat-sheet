# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `id` command in Linux to display information about the current user or any other user on the system. The `id` command can show the user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and the supplementary groups that the user belongs to. You also explored how to use the `-e` option to display the effective user ID and group ID, which are the IDs used for permission checks when executing a command. Additionally, you learned how to use the `id` command to identify the user and group information for other users on the system by specifying their usernames as arguments.
