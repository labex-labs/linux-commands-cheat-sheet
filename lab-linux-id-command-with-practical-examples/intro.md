# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `id` command, which is a useful utility for displaying information about the current user or any other user on the system. We will understand the purpose and usage of the `id` command, learn how to identify user and group information, and explore additional options and customizations.

The `id` command allows you to display the user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and the supplementary groups that a user belongs to. You can use it to get information about the current user or any other user on the system. Additionally, the `id` command can be used to display the effective user ID and group ID, which are the IDs used for permission checks when executing a command.
