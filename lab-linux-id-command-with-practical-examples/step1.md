# Understand the Purpose and Usage of the id Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `id` command in Linux. The `id` command is a useful utility that allows you to display information about the current user or any other user on the system.

The basic usage of the `id` command is as follows:

```
$ id
uid=1000(labex) gid=1000(labex) groups=1000(labex),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lxd),128(sambashare)
```

This command displays the user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and the supplementary groups that the current user belongs to.

You can also use the `id` command to display information about another user by specifying the username as an argument:

```
$ id alice
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lxd),128(sambashare)
```

This will show the user and group information for the user `alice`.

The `id` command can also be used to display the effective user ID and group ID, which are the IDs used for permission checks when executing a command. You can use the `-e` option to display the effective IDs:

```
$ id -e
uid=1000(labex) gid=1000(labex)
```

Example output:

```
uid=1000(labex) gid=1000(labex) groups=1000(labex),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lxd),128(sambashare)
```
