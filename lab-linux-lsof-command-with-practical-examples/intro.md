# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `lsof` command, which stands for "list open files", to identify open files and network connections on a Linux system. The `lsof` command is a powerful tool that provides detailed information about the processes that have open files, including the file descriptor, file type, device, and file name.

The lab covers three main steps: understanding the `lsof` command, identifying open files by a process, and locating network connections using `lsof`. You will learn how to interpret the output of the `lsof` command and use various options to filter the results. This lab is part of the System Monitoring and Management curriculum and will help you develop skills in system administration and troubleshooting.
