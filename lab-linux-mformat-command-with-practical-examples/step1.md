# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the mformat Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `mformat` command in Linux. The `mformat` command is used to create and format floppy disks, which are a type of removable storage media that was commonly used in the past.

To understand the purpose of the `mformat` command, let's first explore the syntax:

```
mformat [options] device
```

The `device` parameter specifies the floppy disk device that you want to format, such as `/dev/fd0` for the first floppy disk drive.

Some common options for the `mformat` command include:

- `-t <tracks>`: Specifies the number of tracks to format on the floppy disk.
- `-h <heads>`: Specifies the number of heads to format on the floppy disk.
- `-s <sectors>`: Specifies the number of sectors to format on each track.
- `-i <size>`: Specifies the size of the floppy disk in bytes.
- `-F <format>`: Specifies the file system format to use on the floppy disk.

Let's try an example of using the `mformat` command to create and format a floppy disk:

```
sudo mformat -t 80 -h 2 -s 18 /dev/fd0
```

Example output:

```
mformat 4.0 (2018-03-19)
Formatting track 0
Formatting track 1
Formatting track 2
...
Formatting track 79
```

In this example, we're formatting a floppy disk with 80 tracks, 2 heads, and 18 sectors per track. The `mformat` command creates a DOS/FAT file system on the floppy disk.
