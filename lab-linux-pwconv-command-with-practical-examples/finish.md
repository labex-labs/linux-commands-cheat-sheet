# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the `pwconv` command in Linux, which is used to convert the traditional password file `/etc/passwd` to the more secure shadow password file `/etc/shadow`. We learned that the `/etc/passwd` file exposes user passwords in plain text, while the `/etc/shadow` file stores encrypted passwords and is only accessible to the root user, providing better password protection.

Next, we covered how to create and manage user passwords using the `pwconv` command. We discussed the process of creating new user accounts and setting their passwords, as well as how to update existing user passwords. Additionally, we explored troubleshooting techniques to address any issues that may arise during the password conversion process.
