# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `pwconv` command and its practical applications in user and permission management. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `pwconv` command, which is used to convert the traditional password file `/etc/passwd` to the more secure shadow password file `/etc/shadow`. Then, we will learn how to create and manage user passwords using the `pwconv` command, ensuring that user passwords are stored securely. Finally, we will discuss how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the password conversion process.
