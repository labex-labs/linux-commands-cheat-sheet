# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `jobs` command in Linux to manage background processes. We started by understanding the basic functionality of the `jobs` command, including how to view, suspend, resume, and terminate background processes. We then explored practical examples of using the `jobs` command, such as starting background processes, suspending and resuming them, and terminating them. Overall, the `jobs` command provides a powerful way to control and monitor background processes in a Linux environment.
