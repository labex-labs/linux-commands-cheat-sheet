# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `jobs` command, which is used to manage background processes. We will start by understanding the basic usage of the `jobs` command, including how to view, suspend, resume, and terminate background processes. Then, we will dive deeper into managing background processes with the `jobs` command, covering practical examples and use cases. This lab aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the `jobs` command and its applications in process management within the Linux operating system.
