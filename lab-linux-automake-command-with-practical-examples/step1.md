# Introduction to Automake

In this step, we will learn about the Automake tool, which is used to generate Makefiles for software projects. Automake is part of the GNU build system and is commonly used in open-source software development.

Automake is a tool that automatically generates Makefiles from a higher-level description file called `Makefile.am`. This file contains instructions for building, installing, and distributing the software. Automake takes care of the details of generating the Makefile, allowing developers to focus on the project structure and build process.

Let's start by installing the necessary packages for using Automake:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y automake
```

Example output:

Now that we have Automake installed, we can start creating a basic Automake project in the next step.
