# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Automake tool, which is used to generate Makefiles for software projects. We started by installing the necessary packages for using Automake, then created a basic Automake project by generating the initial Automake files, including the `configure.ac` and `Makefile.am` files. We also learned how to customize the Automake configuration to suit our project's needs, such as adding source files, libraries, and installation targets.
