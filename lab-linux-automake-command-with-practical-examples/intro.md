# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the Automake tool, which is used to generate Makefiles for software projects. Automake is part of the GNU build system and is commonly used in open-source software development. We will start by installing the necessary packages for using Automake, then create a basic Automake project and generate a Makefile. Finally, we will explore customizing the Automake configuration to suit our project's needs.

The steps in this lab cover the introduction to Automake, creating a basic Automake project, and customizing the Automake configuration. The lab aims to provide a practical understanding of using Automake for managing software build processes.
