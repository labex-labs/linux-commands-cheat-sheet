# Summary

In this lab, you first learned the basics of the awk command, including its syntax and how to use it for simple text processing tasks. You then explored more advanced text processing capabilities of awk, such as extracting specific fields from log files and performing conditional filtering. Finally, you discovered awk's data manipulation and analysis features, which allow you to perform complex operations on structured data.

The key learning points from this lab include understanding the fundamental structure of the awk command, mastering field separation and extraction, and applying awk's powerful pattern matching and conditional logic to solve a variety of text processing and data analysis problems.
