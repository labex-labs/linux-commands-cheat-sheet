# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the powerful awk command in Linux for text processing and data manipulation. The lab covers the basics of the awk command, including its syntax and how to use it for simple text extraction tasks. You will then dive deeper into more advanced text processing and data analysis techniques using awk, such as filtering, transforming, and extracting specific data from log files or other text-based data sources.

The lab is divided into three main steps: understanding the basics of the awk command, performing text processing with awk, and using awk for data manipulation and analysis. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage the awk command to streamline your text processing and data analysis workflows in a Linux environment.
