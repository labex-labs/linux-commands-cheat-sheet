# Understand the Purpose of iwconfig Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `iwconfig` command in Linux. The `iwconfig` command is a powerful tool used to configure and manage wireless network interfaces.

The `iwconfig` command allows you to set various parameters of a wireless network interface, such as the ESSID (network name), frequency, bit rate, encryption keys, and more. It provides a low-level interface to the wireless extensions of the Linux kernel, enabling you to fine-tune your wireless network settings.

Let's start by checking the current status of the wireless network interface using the `iwconfig` command:

```bash
sudo iwconfig
```

Example output:

```
lo        no wireless extensions.
eth0      no wireless extensions.
wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"mynetwork"
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
          Bit Rate=54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off
```

The output shows the status of the wireless network interface `wlan0`, including the ESSID (network name), mode, frequency, access point, bit rate, and other parameters.

Understanding the purpose and usage of the `iwconfig` command is crucial for configuring and troubleshooting wireless network connections on your Linux system.
