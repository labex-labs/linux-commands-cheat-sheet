# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `iwconfig` command, which is a powerful tool for configuring and troubleshooting wireless network interfaces. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `iwconfig` command and how it can be used to set various parameters of a wireless network interface, such as the ESSID (network name), frequency, and bit rate. Then, we will learn how to configure a wireless network interface using the `iwconfig` command, and finally, we will explore how to troubleshoot wireless network issues with the help of this command.
