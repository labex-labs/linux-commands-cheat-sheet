# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `rev` command in Linux to reverse the order of characters in each line of a file, as well as the order of lines within a file. You explored practical examples of reversing text in files and discovered how the `rev` command can be combined with other commands for more complex text manipulations. The key learning points covered in this lab include understanding the basic functionality of the `rev` command, reversing text within files, and reversing the order of lines in files.
