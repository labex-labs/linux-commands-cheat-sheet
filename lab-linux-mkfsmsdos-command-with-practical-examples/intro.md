# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mkfs.msdos` command, which is used to create a FAT32 file system on a storage device. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `mkfs.msdos` command and then learn how to create a FAT32 file system using it. Additionally, we will cover customizing the FAT32 file system parameters to suit our specific needs.

The `mkfs.msdos` command is part of the `util-linux` package, which provides a collection of essential Linux utilities. It is a widely used tool for creating FAT32 file systems, which are compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This makes it a valuable tool for managing external storage devices, such as USB drives and memory cards.
