# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `hostname` command in Linux to display and change the system's hostname. We first explored the basic usage of the `hostname` command, which can display the current hostname, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and the IP addresses of the system. We then learned how to change the hostname temporarily using the `hostname` command, and how to change the hostname permanently by modifying the `/etc/hostname` file. These steps provide a comprehensive understanding of managing the hostname on a Linux system.
