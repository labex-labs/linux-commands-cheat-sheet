# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the Linux `hostname` command, which is used to display or set the system's host name. We first understand the basic usage of the `hostname` command and how to retrieve various information about the system's hostname and network configuration. Then, we learn how to change the hostname temporarily and permanently, which is useful for system administration and troubleshooting tasks. The lab provides practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help users effectively manage the hostname on their Linux systems.
