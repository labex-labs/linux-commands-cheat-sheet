# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `hwclock` command in Linux to interact with the system's hardware clock. The `hwclock` command allows you to synchronize the system time with the hardware clock, as well as manually adjust the hardware clock. You will start by understanding the purpose and functionality of the `hwclock` command, then proceed to synchronize the system time with the hardware clock, and finally learn how to manually adjust the hardware clock.

The `hwclock` command is a useful tool for managing the system's time and ensuring that it is accurately maintained, even when the system is powered off. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to effectively use the `hwclock` command to manage your Linux system's time and clock settings.
