# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `zdiff` command in Linux, which is used to compare the contents of compressed files such as `.gz`, `.bz2`, or `.xz` files. You explored the various options available with the `zdiff` command, including quiet mode, silent mode, verbose mode, context diff, and unified diff. You then learned how to use the `zdiff` command to compare compressed files by creating two sample compressed files and comparing their contents.
