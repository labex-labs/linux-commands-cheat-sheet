# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `hostname` command, which is used to display or set the hostname of the system. We learned how to use various options with the `hostname` command to display different aspects of the system's hostname, such as the alias, DNS domain name, fully qualified domain name, network addresses, and short host name. We then explored the `hostnamectl` command, which provides a more comprehensive way to manage the hostname of the system. We learned how to use `hostnamectl` to display detailed information about the system, including the static hostname, icon name, machine ID, boot ID, virtualization type, operating system, kernel version, and architecture. Finally, we demonstrated how to change the hostname using the `hostnamectl set-hostname` command.
