# Explore Advanced bzip2recover Options

In this final step, we will explore some advanced options available with the `bzip2recover` command.

By default, the `bzip2recover` command tries to recover data from a corrupted bzip2 file. However, you can also use additional options to customize the recovery process.

Let's start by creating another corrupted bzip2 file:

```bash
# Create a sample file
echo "This is another test file." > another_sample_file.txt

# Compress the file using bzip2
bzip2 another_sample_file.txt

# Corrupt the bzip2 file
dd if=/dev/urandom of=another_sample_file.txt.bz2 bs=1 count=20 conv=notrunc
```

Now, let's try to recover the data using the `-s` (--small) option:

```bash
bzip2recover -s another_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

The `-s` option tells `bzip2recover` to use less memory during the recovery process, which can be useful if you have limited system resources.

Example output:

```
bzip2recover: Assuming input file is corrupted.
bzip2recover: Trying to recover data from corrupted file...
bzip2recover: Recovered data written to recovered_another_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

Another useful option is `-f` (--force), which tells `bzip2recover` to overwrite any existing output files without prompting:

```bash
bzip2recover -f another_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

This can be helpful if you want to automate the recovery process or if you don't care about preserving any existing recovered files.

Finally, you can use the `-v` (--verbose) option to get more detailed output during the recovery process:

```bash
bzip2recover -v another_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

Example output:

```
bzip2recover: Assuming input file is corrupted.
bzip2recover: Trying to recover data from corrupted file...
bzip2recover: Found block 1 at offset 0
bzip2recover: Found block 2 at offset 1234567
bzip2recover: Found block 3 at offset 2345678
bzip2recover: Recovered data written to recovered_another_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

The verbose output can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding the recovery process in more detail.
