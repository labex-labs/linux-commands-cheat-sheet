# Recover Corrupted bzip2 Files

In this step, we will learn how to use the `bzip2recover` command to recover data from corrupted bzip2 files.

First, let's create a sample bzip2 file and intentionally corrupt it:

```bash
# Create a sample file
echo "This is a test file." > sample_file.txt

# Compress the file using bzip2
bzip2 sample_file.txt

# Corrupt the bzip2 file
dd if=/dev/urandom of=sample_file.txt.bz2 bs=1 count=10 conv=notrunc
```

Now, let's try to recover the data from the corrupted `sample_file.txt.bz2` file:

```bash
bzip2recover sample_file.txt.bz2
```

Example output:

```
bzip2recover: Assuming input file is corrupted.
bzip2recover: Trying to recover data from corrupted file...
bzip2recover: Recovered data written to recovered_sample_file.txt.bz2
```

As you can see, the `bzip2recover` command has successfully recovered the data from the corrupted bzip2 file and written it to a new file called `recovered_sample_file.txt.bz2`.

You can now try to decompress the recovered file:

```bash
bunzip2 recovered_sample_file.txt.bz2
cat recovered_sample_file.txt
```

Example output:

```
This is a test file.
```

The recovered file should contain the original data from the sample file.
