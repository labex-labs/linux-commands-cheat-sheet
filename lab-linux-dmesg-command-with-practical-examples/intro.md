# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `dmesg` command and how to use it to explore the kernel ring buffer. The `dmesg` command is a powerful tool for system monitoring and management, as it provides access to valuable kernel-level messages that can be used for troubleshooting and monitoring system health.

You will start by understanding the purpose and usage of the `dmesg` command, which allows you to view the contents of the kernel ring buffer. This circular buffer stores messages generated by the Linux kernel during system boot and runtime, including information about hardware initialization, driver loading, and system events. You will then explore various options to filter and analyze the `dmesg` output, enabling you to focus on specific types of messages or log levels.
