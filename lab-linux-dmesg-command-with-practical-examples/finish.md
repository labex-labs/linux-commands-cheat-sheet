# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `dmesg` command in Linux. The `dmesg` command is used to view the kernel ring buffer, which contains messages generated by the Linux kernel during system boot and runtime. You explored how to use the `dmesg` command to access and analyze these kernel-level messages, which can be useful for troubleshooting system issues and monitoring system health. You also learned about various options to filter and format the `dmesg` output, such as displaying timestamps, filtering by log level, and setting the console log level.
