# Practical Examples of Using the factor Command

In this final step, we will explore some practical examples of using the `factor` command in real-world scenarios.

One common use case for the `factor` command is to find the prime factorization of large numbers. This can be useful in number theory, cryptography, and other mathematical applications. Let's try factoring a larger number:

```bash
factor 1234567
```

Example output:

```
1234567: 3 7 59 2903
```

As you can see, the `factor` command has identified the prime factors of 1,234,567 as 3, 7, 59, and 2,903.

Another practical use case for the `factor` command is to check if a number is prime. If a number has only two factors (1 and itself), then it is a prime number. Let's try this:

```bash
factor 17
```

Example output:

```
17: 17
```

Since the output shows that 17 has only one prime factor (17 itself), we can conclude that 17 is a prime number.

You can also use the `factor` command to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the given numbers without a remainder. To find the GCD, you can factor the numbers and look for the common prime factors.

For example, let's find the GCD of 24 and 36:

```bash
factor 24 36
```

Example output:

```
24: 2 2 2 3
36: 2 2 3 3
```

The common prime factors between 24 and 36 are 2 and 3. Therefore, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 2 x 3 = 6.

The `factor` command is a versatile and powerful tool that can be used in a variety of practical applications. By understanding its syntax and usage, you can leverage this command to solve various mathematical and computational problems.
