# Explore the Syntax and Usage of the factor Command

In this step, we will explore the syntax and usage of the `factor` command in more detail.

The basic syntax of the `factor` command is:

```bash
factor [number]
```

Where `[number]` is the integer you want to find the prime factorization for.

You can use the `factor` command with a single number, as we did in the previous step:

```bash
factor 12
```

Example output:

```
12: 2 2 3
```

You can also use the `factor` command with multiple numbers, separating them with spaces:

```bash
factor 12 24 36
```

Example output:

```
12: 2 2 3
24: 2 2 2 3
36: 2 2 3 3
```

In this case, the `factor` command will display the prime factorization for each of the numbers provided.

Additionally, you can use the `factor` command with input redirection to read numbers from a file:

```bash
cat numbers.txt
12
24
36

factor < numbers.txt
```

Example output:

```
12: 2 2 3
24: 2 2 2 3
36: 2 2 3 3
```

This can be useful if you have a large number of numbers to factor.

The `factor` command is a simple but powerful tool for understanding the prime factorization of integers. It can be particularly useful in mathematical and scientific applications, as well as for educational purposes.
