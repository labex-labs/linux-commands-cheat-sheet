# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the Linux `factor` command, which is a utility for finding the prime factorization of a given number. The `factor` command can be a useful tool for understanding the underlying structure of numbers, particularly in mathematical and scientific applications.

We will start by understanding the purpose of the `factor` command, learning how to use it to find the prime factorization of different numbers. Then, we will dive deeper into the syntax and usage of the command, exploring various ways to input numbers and handle multiple inputs. The lab provides practical examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the `factor` command, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in working with numbers and their prime factors.
