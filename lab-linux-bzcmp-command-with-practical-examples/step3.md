# Explore Advanced Options of bzcmp

In this final step, we will explore some of the advanced options available with the `bzcmp` command.

One useful option is `--ignore-case`, which allows you to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the compressed files:

```bash
bzcmp --ignore-case file1.bz2 file2.bz2
```

This will compare the files without considering the case of the characters.

Another option is `--quiet`, which suppresses the output if the files are identical:

```bash
bzcmp --quiet file1.bz2 file2.bz2
```

If the files are the same, this command will not output anything. You can use this option if you only want to know whether the files are different or not, without seeing the detailed differences.

You can also use the `--speed-large-files` option, which can improve the performance of `bzcmp` when dealing with large compressed files:

```bash
bzcmp --speed-large-files file1.bz2 file2.bz2
```

This option tells `bzcmp` to use a faster, but less thorough, comparison algorithm for large files, which can save time.

Finally, you can use the `--help` option to see all the available options for the `bzcmp` command:

```bash
bzcmp --help
```

This will display a comprehensive list of all the options and their descriptions, which can be helpful if you need to perform more advanced comparisons of compressed files.
