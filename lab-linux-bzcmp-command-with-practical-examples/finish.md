# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and usage of the `bzcmp` command in Linux, which allows you to compare compressed files without having to decompress them first. We learned how to check the version of `bzcmp` installed on the system and understand the basic usage of the command to compare two compressed files. In the second part, we created two sample compressed files and used the `bzcmp` command to compare their contents, identifying the differences between them. We also explored the `--verbose` option to get more detailed information about the differences.
