In this lab, we will explore the Linux `bzcmp` command, which allows you to compare compressed files using the bzip2 compression algorithm. The lab will cover the purpose of the `bzcmp` command, demonstrate how to use it to compare compressed files, and explore its advanced options. This lab is part of the Miscellaneous Utilities category and will provide practical examples to help you effectively work with compressed files in your Linux environment.
