# Understand the Purpose of bzcmp Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `bzcmp` command in Linux. The `bzcmp` command is a utility that allows you to compare compressed files, specifically those compressed using the bzip2 compression algorithm.

The `bzcmp` command is useful when you need to compare the contents of two compressed files without having to decompress them first. This can save time and disk space, especially when dealing with large files.

Let's start by checking the version of `bzcmp` installed on our system:

```bash
bzcmp --version
```

Example output:

```
bzcmp (bzip2) 1.0.8
Copyright (C) 1996-2019 Julian Seward <jseward@acm.org>
```

As you can see, the `bzcmp` command is part of the bzip2 compression utility suite.

Now, let's understand the basic usage of `bzcmp` by comparing two compressed files:

```bash
bzcmp file1.bz2 file2.bz2
```

The `bzcmp` command will compare the contents of the two compressed files and display the differences, if any. If the files are identical, it will not output anything.
