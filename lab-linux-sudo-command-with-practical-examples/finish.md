# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and importance of the `sudo` command in Linux. The `sudo` command allows users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user, typically the superuser or root user. This is essential for system administration tasks, as it enables users to perform actions that require elevated permissions, such as installing software or modifying system configurations, while maintaining the security of the system. You also explored how to use the `sudo` command and understand the security measures in place, such as the requirement to enter the user's password before executing a command with elevated privileges.

Next, you will learn how to manage user permissions with `sudo` and secure your system with proper `sudo` usage.
