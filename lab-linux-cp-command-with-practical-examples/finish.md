# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basic usage of the `cp` command in Linux, which is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. You started by creating a sample file and copying it to a new file. You also learned how to copy directories recursively using the `-r` option. Additionally, you explored copying multiple files and directories at once, which can save time and simplify the copying process. The lab provided practical examples to help you understand the various capabilities of the `cp` command and how to effectively use it in your daily Linux workflows.
