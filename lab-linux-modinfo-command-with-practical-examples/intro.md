# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `modinfo` command to explore and troubleshoot kernel modules. The `modinfo` command provides detailed information about kernel modules, including their filename, author, description, license, dependencies, and configurable parameters. This knowledge can be helpful when troubleshooting issues related to kernel modules or when trying to understand the functionality and configuration options of a specific module.
