# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `disable` command in Linux to disable system services and programs, preventing them from starting automatically at system boot. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues, optimizing system performance, and improving security by disabling unused services.

You will start by understanding the purpose of the `disable` command and how it can be used to disable services. Then, you will practice disabling the `nginx` service and verifying its disabled status. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to effectively manage system services using the `disable` command.
