# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the bison command, a parser generator tool used in the development of compilers and interpreters. Bison is a free software implementation of YACC, a powerful tool for generating parsers from a context-free grammar specification. We will start by installing the bison package on our Ubuntu 22.04 environment, then create a simple grammar file and generate a parser using the bison command. Finally, we will learn how to handle syntax errors in the generated parser.

The lab covers the following steps:

- Introduction to bison Command
- Generating Parsers with bison
- Handling Syntax Errors in bison
