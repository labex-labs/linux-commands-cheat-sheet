# Summary

In this lab, we explored the bison command, which is a parser generator tool used in the development of compilers and interpreters. We first learned how to install the bison package on Ubuntu 22.04 and then created a simple grammar file to define a calculator-like language. We then generated the parser source code using the bison command, which produced two files: the parser implementation and the header file. Finally, we learned how to handle syntax errors in the generated parser.
