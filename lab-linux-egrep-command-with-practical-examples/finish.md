# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the egrep command, which is an extended version of the grep command that provides more advanced pattern matching capabilities using regular expressions. You explored the basic usage of egrep, including how to perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches, and how to use regular expression patterns to search for more complex patterns in text data.

Next, you delved deeper into using egrep with more complex regular expressions to search for patterns in your text data. You learned how to use regular expressions to search for lines containing specific name patterns, as well as how to combine egrep with other Linux commands to perform powerful text processing tasks.
