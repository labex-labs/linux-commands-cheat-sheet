# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `colrm` command in Linux, which is used to remove specific columns from a file. We started by understanding the basic usage of `colrm`, where we can specify the starting and ending columns to be removed. We then demonstrated how to remove specific columns from a sample file and how to combine `colrm` with other Linux commands like `awk` for more advanced text processing tasks.
