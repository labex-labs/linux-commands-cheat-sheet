# Combine colrm with Other Linux Commands

In this step, we will explore how to combine the `colrm` command with other Linux commands to perform more advanced text processing tasks.

Let's create a sample file with multiple columns:

```bash
echo "Name,Age,Gender,City" > sample.csv
echo "John,25,Male,New York" >> sample.csv
echo "Jane,30,Female,London" >> sample.csv
echo "Bob,35,Male,Paris" >> sample.csv
```

Now, let's say we want to extract the name and city columns from the CSV file. We can use `colrm` in combination with `awk` to achieve this:

```bash
cat sample.csv | awk -F, '{print $1, $4}' | colrm 3 3
```

Example output:

```
Name City
John New York
Jane London
Bob Paris
```

In this example, we first use `awk` to split the input line by the comma (`,`) delimiter and print the first and fourth columns. Then, we use `colrm` to remove the third column (the gender column) from the output.

You can also combine `colrm` with other commands like `sed` or `cut` to perform more complex text processing tasks. For example, let's say we want to remove the header row and only keep the data rows:

```bash
cat sample.csv | sed '1d' | colrm 3 3
```

Example output:

```
John New York
Jane London
Bob Paris
```

In this case, we use `sed '1d'` to remove the first line (the header row) and then apply the `colrm` command to remove the third column.

The combination of `colrm` with other Linux commands can be very powerful for tasks like data extraction, reformatting, and manipulation.
