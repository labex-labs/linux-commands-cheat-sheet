# Understand the colrm Command

In this step, we will learn about the `colrm` command in Linux, which is used to remove specific columns from a file.

The `colrm` command takes two arguments: the starting column and the ending column to be removed. It reads input from standard input (usually a file) and writes the output to standard output, with the specified columns removed.

Let's create a sample file to work with:

```bash
echo "1 2 3 4 5" > sample.txt
```

Now, let's remove the second and fourth columns from the file:

```bash
cat sample.txt | colrm 2 4
```

Example output:

```
1 3 5
```

The `colrm` command has removed the second and fourth columns from the input file, leaving only the first, third, and fifth columns.

You can also use `colrm` to remove a single column by specifying the same starting and ending column numbers:

```bash
cat sample.txt | colrm 3 3
```

Example output:

```
1 2 4 5
```

In this case, the third column has been removed from the input file.

The `colrm` command can be combined with other Linux commands for more advanced text processing tasks. For example, you can use `colrm` with `awk` to remove specific columns and perform additional operations:

```bash
cat sample.txt | awk '{$2=""; print}' OFS=" "
```

Example output:

```
1  3 4 5
```

In this example, we use `awk` to remove the second column and then print the modified line.
