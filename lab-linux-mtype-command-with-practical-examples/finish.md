# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `mtype` command, which is used to display the contents of a file in a specific format. We learned that the `mtype` command is particularly useful for viewing files with special characters or formatting, such as binary files or files with non-ASCII characters. We also explored the various options available with the `mtype` command, including the ability to display binary data in octal, show control characters, and use form feeds instead of newlines.

The `mtype` command is part of the GNU sharutils package, which provides a set of utilities for handling archives and special files. We learned how to check the version of the `mtype` command installed on our system and how to use it to display the contents of both text and binary files in a readable format.
