# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mtype` command, which is used to display the contents of a file in a readable format. The `mtype` command is particularly useful for viewing files with special characters or formatting, such as binary files or files with non-ASCII characters. We will start by understanding the basic usage of the `mtype` command, and then explore the various options available to customize its behavior, including displaying binary data in octal, showing control characters, and using form feeds instead of newlines.
