# Understand the mtype Command

In this step, we will explore the Linux `mtype` command, which is used to display the contents of a file in a specific format. The `mtype` command is particularly useful for viewing files with special characters or formatting, such as binary files or files with non-ASCII characters.

First, let's check the version of the `mtype` command installed on our system:

```bash
mtype --version
```

Example output:

```
mtype (GNU sharutils) 4.15.2

The `mtype` command is part of the GNU sharutils package, which provides a set of utilities for handling archives and special files.

Next, let's explore the basic usage of the `mtype` command:

```bash
mtype file.txt
```

This will display the contents of the `file.txt` file in a readable format, even if the file contains special characters or non-ASCII text.

You can also use the `mtype` command to display the contents of a binary file:

```bash
mtype binary_file.dat
```

The `mtype` command will attempt to display the contents of the binary file in a human-readable format, making it easier to understand the file's structure and contents.
