# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `mesg` command in Linux, which is used to control the permission to send messages to the user's terminal. We explored how to check the current message permission status, deny message receiving, and allow message receiving again. Additionally, we learned how to send messages to other terminal users on the same system using the `write` and `wall` commands, and how to restrict message receiving permissions for specific users.

The lab provided a comprehensive understanding of managing message permissions and communication between users in a Linux environment.
