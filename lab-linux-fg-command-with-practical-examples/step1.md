# Understand the Purpose of the fg Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `fg` command in Linux. The `fg` command is used to bring a background process to the foreground, allowing you to interact with it directly.

In Linux, when you run a command, it can either run in the foreground or the background. Foreground processes are the ones you can interact with directly, while background processes run without user interaction.

To start a process in the background, you can append the `&` character at the end of the command. For example:

```bash
sleep 60 &
```

This will start the `sleep` command in the background, and you'll get the process ID (PID) of the background process.

Example output:

```
[1] 12345
```

Now, to bring this background process to the foreground, you can use the `fg` command:

```bash
fg
```

This will bring the most recent background process to the foreground, allowing you to interact with it.

If you have multiple background processes, you can use the `fg` command with the PID or the job number (the number in the square brackets) to bring a specific process to the foreground. For example:

```bash
fg 12345
```

or

```bash
fg %1
```

Both of these commands will bring the background process with the PID 12345 or the job number 1 to the foreground.
