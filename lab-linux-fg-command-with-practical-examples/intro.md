# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `fg` command in Linux to bring background processes to the foreground. The lab covers the purpose of the `fg` command, how to bring a background process to the foreground, and how to manage multiple background processes using the `fg` command. You will learn practical examples and gain a better understanding of process management in the Linux operating system.

The lab starts by explaining the purpose of the `fg` command and how it is used to interact with background processes. It then demonstrates how to start a background process and bring it to the foreground using the `fg` command. Finally, the lab covers managing multiple background processes by using the `fg` command with the process ID (PID) or job number.
