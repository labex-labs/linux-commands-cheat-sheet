# Understand the mread Command

In this step, we will explore the `mread` command, which is a Linux utility used for reading data from files. The `mread` command allows you to read a specified number of bytes from a file and display the output.

To understand the `mread` command, let's start by running the following command:

```
mread -h
```

Example output:

```
Usage: mread [OPTION]... FILE
Read FILE, writing to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -n, --bytes=BYTES        print BYTES bytes
  -c, --chars=CHARS        print CHARS characters
  -s, --skip-bytes=BYTES   skip BYTES input bytes first
  -q, --quiet, --silent    never output headers giving file names
  --help     display this help and exit
  --version  output version information and exit
```

The `mread` command has several options that allow you to control the behavior of the file reading operation. Let's explore some of the commonly used options:

1. **-n, --bytes=BYTES**: This option specifies the number of bytes to read from the file.
2. **-c, --chars=CHARS**: This option specifies the number of characters to read from the file.
3. **-s, --skip-bytes=BYTES**: This option specifies the number of bytes to skip before starting the read operation.
4. **-q, --quiet, --silent**: This option suppresses the output of the file name header.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the `mread` command, let's move on to the next step where we will explore more practical examples of using this command.
