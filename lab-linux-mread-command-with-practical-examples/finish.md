# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `mread` command, which is used for reading data from files. We learned about the various options available with the `mread` command, such as reading a specific number of bytes, characters, or skipping bytes before reading. We also saw practical examples of using the `mread` command to read files in different ways. The key takeaways from this lab are understanding the basic usage of the `mread` command and its options, and applying them to read files effectively.
