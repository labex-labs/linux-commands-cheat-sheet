# Customize minicom Settings for Better User Experience

In this step, we will explore how to customize the minicom settings to improve the user experience.

First, let's open the minicom configuration menu:

```bash
sudo minicom -s
```

Here are some settings you can customize:

1. **Screen and keyboard**:

   - Change the screen colors
   - Adjust the font size
   - Enable/disable local echo

2. **Modem and dialing**:

   - Configure the dialing directory
   - Set the default baud rate and other serial parameters

3. **File transfer protocols**:

   - Choose the preferred file transfer protocol (e.g., Xmodem, Zmodem)
   - Configure the file transfer directory

4. **Save setup as dfl**:
   - Save your customized settings as the default configuration

For example, to change the screen colors, navigate to the "Screen and keyboard" option, select "Screen color" and choose the desired color scheme.

Example output:

```
+-----[configuration]------+
| Filenames and paths      |
| File transfer protocols |
| Serial port setup       |
| Modem and dialing       |
| Screen and keyboard     |
| Save setup as dfl       |
| Exit from minicom       |
+-------------------------+
Screen color
```

Once you have made the desired changes, select "Save setup as dfl" to save the configuration as the default.

Now, whenever you start minicom, it will use your customized settings.
