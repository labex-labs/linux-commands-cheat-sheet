# Customizing the pico Editor Environment

In this step, you will learn how to customize the pico editor environment to suit your preferences.

Pico allows you to customize various settings, such as the editor's appearance, behavior, and default options. These customizations are stored in the `~/.pinerc` configuration file.

First, let's create the `~/.pinerc` file if it doesn't already exist:

```
touch ~/.pinerc
```

Now, open the `~/.pinerc` file using the pico editor:

```
pico ~/.pinerc
```

Here are some common customization options you can add to the `~/.pinerc` file:

- `color-normal = white on blue`: Set the default color scheme for the editor.
- `color-selected = black on cyan`: Set the color scheme for the selected text.
- `wrap-margin = 78`: Set the maximum line width before wrapping.
- `spell-program = /usr/bin/aspell`: Specify the spell checker program to use.
- `editor-line-numbers = yes`: Display line numbers in the editor.
- `smart-home-end = yes`: Enable smart Home and End key behavior.

After making the desired changes, save the `~/.pinerc` file by pressing `Ctrl+O` and then exit pico with `Ctrl+X`.

Now, when you open the pico editor, it will use the customized settings you've defined in the `~/.pinerc` file.
