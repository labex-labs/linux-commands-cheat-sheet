# Introduction to the pico Text Editor

In this step, you will be introduced to the pico text editor, a user-friendly command-line tool for text processing and editing on Linux systems. Pico is a simple and intuitive editor that provides a straightforward interface for creating, modifying, and saving text files.

First, let's check if pico is installed on the system. Run the following command:

```
which pico
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/pico
```

The output shows that pico is installed and the executable is located at `/usr/bin/pico`.

Next, let's start the pico editor by running the following command:

```
pico
```

This will open the pico editor with a blank file. You can now start typing and editing text.

Some basic pico commands:

- `Ctrl + G`: Display the help menu
- `Ctrl + X`: Exit the editor and save the file
- `Ctrl + O`: Save the file
- `Ctrl + K`: Cut a line of text
- `Ctrl + U`: Uncut (paste) the last line that was cut

Try using these basic commands to create a new file, add some text, and save the file.
