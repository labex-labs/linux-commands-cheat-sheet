# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `fsck.minix` command, which is used to check and repair Minix file systems. We started by exploring the basic usage of the command, including checking the version and understanding the common options. We then learned how to create a Minix file system on a loopback device, mount it, and use the `fsck.minix` command to check and repair the file system. The lab provided practical examples to demonstrate the usage of the `fsck.minix` command, which is an essential tool for maintaining the integrity of Minix file systems.
