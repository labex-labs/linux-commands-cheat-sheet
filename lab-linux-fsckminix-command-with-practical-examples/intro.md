# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `fsck.minix` command, which is used to check and repair Minix file systems, one of the earliest file system types used in Linux. We will learn how to use this command to verify the integrity of a Minix file system and, if necessary, repair any inconsistencies found. The lab will cover the basic usage of `fsck.minix`, including creating a Minix file system, checking its integrity, and repairing any issues that may arise.
