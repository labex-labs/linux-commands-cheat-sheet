# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the bzip2 compression utility in Linux, including how to check the version installed and explore the available options. You then created a sample text file and practiced compressing and decompressing it using the bzip2 command. The lab covered the basic usage of bzip2 for compressing and decompressing files, demonstrating the improved compression ratios compared to the standard gzip utility.
