# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and functionality of the `journalctl` command in Linux. We learned that the `journalctl` command is used to view and analyze the system logs maintained by the systemd journal, which collects and stores logs from the kernel, system services, and user applications. We then ran the `journalctl` command without any options to see the entire log history, and discussed the key features of the command, including the ability to filter logs based on various criteria and view logs for specific services.

Next, we will explore the advanced filtering options available with the `journalctl` command, and learn how to analyze the logs using various commands.
