# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the concept of disk quota in Linux, which allows system administrators to limit the amount of disk space that a user or group can consume on a file system. We then learned how to enable disk quota on a Linux file system by mounting it with the appropriate options. Finally, we explored how to manage user disk quotas using the `edquota` command.
