# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `edquota` command and learn how to manage disk quotas on a Linux file system. We will start by understanding the concept of disk quota, which allows system administrators to limit the amount of disk space that a user or group can consume. Then, we will learn how to enable disk quota on a Linux file system and use the `edquota` command to set and manage user disk quotas. This lab will provide practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you effectively manage disk space usage in your Linux environment.
