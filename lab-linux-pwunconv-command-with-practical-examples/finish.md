# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `pwunconv` command in Linux, which is used to secure user passwords by moving them from the shadow file to the password file. We started by checking the current state of the user password storage and then used the `pwunconv` command to move the passwords to the `/etc/passwd` file. We also learned how to secure the user passwords by disabling the shadow password system using the `pwconv` command.
