# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `pwunconv` command in Linux, which is used to secure user passwords by moving them from the shadow file to the password file. We will cover the introduction to the `pwunconv` command, the process of securing user passwords with it, and practical scenarios for using this command. The `pwunconv` command is part of the shadow password suite, a set of tools used to manage user passwords and account information in Linux.

After introducing the `pwunconv` command and its purpose, the lab will guide you through the steps of moving the passwords from the `/etc/shadow` file to the `/etc/passwd` file, and then disabling the shadow password system to enhance the security of user passwords on your Linux system.
