# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `umount` command, which is used to unmount a mounted file system. We will learn how to unmount a file system both normally and forcefully, as well as understand the use cases for the `umount` command.

The lab covers the following steps: understanding the `umount` command, unmounting a mounted file system, and unmounting a mounted file system forcefully. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively manage mounted file systems using the `umount` command.
