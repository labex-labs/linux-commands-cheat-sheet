# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Linux `umount` command, which is used to unmount a mounted file system. We first understood the basic usage of the `umount` command, where it takes the mount point as an argument and unmounts the file system from that location. However, if the file system is in use, the `umount` command may fail, in which case we can use the `-f` (force) option to forcefully unmount the file system. We then practiced unmounting a mounted file system, both normally and forcefully, using the `umount` command.
