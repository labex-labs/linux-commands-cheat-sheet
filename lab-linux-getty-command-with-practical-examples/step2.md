# Explore the Different getty Command Options

In this step, we will explore the different options available with the `getty` command and learn how to configure and manage virtual terminals using it.

Let's start by looking at some of the commonly used `getty` command options:

```bash
sudo getty -m -n -t 60 tty1
```

This command will:

- `-m`: Print the `/etc/issue` message of the day before the login prompt
- `-n`: Skip the login prompt and directly launch the login process
- `-t 60`: Set the login timeout to 60 seconds

Example output:

```
Linux ubuntu 5.15.0-1023-aws #25~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 30 12:36:29 UTC 2022 x86_64

ubuntu login:
```

Another useful option is `--flow-control`, which enables input flow control for the terminal:

```bash
sudo getty --flow-control tty2
```

This will start a new virtual terminal on `tty2` with input flow control enabled.

You can also set the initial string to be sent to the terminal using the `-I` option:

```bash
sudo getty -I "Welcome to the Lab!" tty3
```

This will start a new virtual terminal on `tty3` and display the "Welcome to the Lab!" message before the login prompt.

In the next step, we will learn how to configure and manage virtual terminals using the `getty` command.
