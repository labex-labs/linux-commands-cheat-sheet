# Configure and Manage Virtual Terminals using getty

In this final step, we will learn how to configure and manage virtual terminals using the `getty` command.

First, let's create a new virtual terminal:

```bash
sudo getty tty4
```

This will start a new virtual terminal on `tty4`. You can switch to this terminal by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+F4`.

To configure the virtual terminal, we can use the `getty` command with various options. For example, to set the login timeout to 120 seconds:

```bash
sudo getty -t 120 tty4
```

You can also set the initial string to be displayed before the login prompt:

```bash
sudo getty -I "Welcome to the Virtual Terminal!" tty4
```

To stop a virtual terminal, you can use the `kill` command:

```bash
sudo kill $(ps -ef | grep getty | grep tty4 | awk '{print $2}')
```

This will stop the `getty` process running on the `tty4` virtual terminal.

Finally, let's create a script to automatically start and configure multiple virtual terminals:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start virtual terminals
sudo getty tty4 &
sudo getty -t 60 tty5 &
sudo getty -I "Virtual Terminal 6" tty6 &

# Wait for the terminals to be ready
sleep 5

# Switch to the first virtual terminal
sudo chvt 4
```

Save this script as `start_terminals.sh` in your `~/project` directory and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/project/start_terminals.sh
```

Now, you can run the script to start the virtual terminals:

```bash
~/project/start_terminals.sh
```

You can switch between the virtual terminals using the `Ctrl+Alt+F4`, `Ctrl+Alt+F5`, and `Ctrl+Alt+F6` key combinations.
