# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `getty` command, which is a crucial utility for managing virtual terminals and allowing users to log in to the system. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `getty` command, which is responsible for initializing and configuring virtual terminals, prompting users for their login credentials, and launching the login process after successful authentication. We will then explore the different options available for the `getty` command and learn how to configure and manage virtual terminals using this tool.
