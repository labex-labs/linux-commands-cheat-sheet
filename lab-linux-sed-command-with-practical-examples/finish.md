# Summary

In this lab, we learned the basics of the sed command in Linux, including printing the entire file, printing specific lines, performing text substitution, deleting lines, and inserting or appending text. We also explored more advanced text substitution using sed, where we learned how to replace multiple occurrences of a word in a file, as well as how to edit multiple files simultaneously with sed.

The key takeaways from this lab are the versatility and power of the sed command for text processing and editing tasks in the Linux environment.
