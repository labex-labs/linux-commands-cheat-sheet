# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the cron service in Linux, which is a time-based job scheduler. We will learn how to view and edit the crontab, schedule a simple cron job, and configure cron notifications and logging. The cron service is a built-in feature of Linux, and the commands used in this lab are widely supported across different Linux distributions. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively manage and schedule tasks using the cron service.
