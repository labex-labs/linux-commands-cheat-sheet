# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the cron service in Linux, which is a time-based job scheduler. You explored how to view and edit the crontab, the configuration file for cron jobs, and how to schedule a simple cron job that runs a script every minute. You also learned about the format of the crontab file and the different fields that define when a job should run. Finally, you configured cron notifications and logging to monitor the execution of your scheduled tasks.
