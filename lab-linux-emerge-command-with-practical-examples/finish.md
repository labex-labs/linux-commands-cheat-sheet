# Summary

In this lab, we explored the emerge command, which is the package management tool used in Gentoo Linux and its derivatives. We learned how to check the version of the emerge command, and how to use it to install, update, and upgrade packages on the system. We also learned how to update the package database and check for available package updates, as well as how to perform a full system upgrade using the emerge command.
