# Introduction to the emerge Command

In this step, we will explore the emerge command, which is the package management tool used in Gentoo Linux and its derivatives. The emerge command is a powerful tool that allows you to install, update, and manage packages on your system.

First, let's check the version of the emerge command installed on our system:

```
sudo emerge --version
```

Example output:

```
Portage 3.0.28 (python 3.10.6-final-0, default/linux/amd64/17.1, gcc-12.2.0, glibc-2.36-r3, 5.15.0-57-generic x86_64)
```

As you can see, the emerge command is part of the Portage package management system used in Gentoo Linux. Portage is a sophisticated package management system that provides advanced features like dependency resolution, package masking, and more.

Now, let's explore some basic usage of the emerge command:
