# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `nice` command in Linux, which allows us to adjust the priority of a process. We started by understanding the `nice` command and how it sets the niceness value of a process, which determines its scheduling priority. We then practiced adjusting the priority of processes by running commands with different niceness values. By using the `nice` command, we can control the relative priority of processes running on a system, which can be useful for optimizing system performance or ensuring critical tasks have the resources they need.
