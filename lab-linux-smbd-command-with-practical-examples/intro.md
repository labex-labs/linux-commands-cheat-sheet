# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `smbd` command, which is a key component of the Samba server. The `smbd` daemon is responsible for providing file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. We will learn how to configure the Samba server, manage Samba shares, and set permissions. The lab covers the introduction to the `smbd` command, configuring the Samba server, and managing Samba shares and permissions.
