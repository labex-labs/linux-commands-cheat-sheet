# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the `smbd` command, which is the main Samba server process responsible for providing file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. We learned how to check the status of the Samba service, start the `smbd` service, and understand its role in the Samba server. Next, we configured the Samba server by installing the Samba package and modifying the default Samba configuration file, `smb.conf`, to set up the workgroup and shared directories.
