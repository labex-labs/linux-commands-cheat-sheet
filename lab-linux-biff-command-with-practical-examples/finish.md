# Summary

In this lab, we explored the biff command, a utility in Linux that allows users to receive notifications when new mail arrives in their mailbox. We learned how to enable and disable biff, as well as how to customize the notification message by creating a `.biffrc` file. We also configured biff to receive notifications and tested the custom notification message by simulating new mail arrival. The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help users understand and utilize the biff command effectively.
