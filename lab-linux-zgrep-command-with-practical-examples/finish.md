# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `zgrep` command, which allows you to search for patterns in compressed files without the need to decompress them first. You created a compressed file and used `zgrep` to search for a pattern, including using regular expressions. Additionally, you learned how to decompress compressed files using `zcat` and then search for patterns using the `grep` command. These techniques are particularly useful when working with large compressed files, as they save time and resources by avoiding the decompression step.
