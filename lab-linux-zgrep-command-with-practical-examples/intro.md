# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `zgrep` command in Linux to search for patterns in compressed files without the need to decompress them first. You will also explore how to decompress compressed files and then search for patterns using the `grep` command. The lab covers practical examples and demonstrates the benefits of using `zgrep` when working with large compressed files, as it saves time and resources by avoiding the decompression step. Additionally, you will learn how to combine `zgrep` with other Linux commands to enhance your workflow.
