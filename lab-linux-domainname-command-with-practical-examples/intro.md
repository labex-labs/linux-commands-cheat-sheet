# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `domainname` command, which is used to display or set the domain name of the system. The lab will cover understanding the `domainname` command, setting and displaying the domain name, and managing the domain name across network interfaces. We will provide practical examples to demonstrate the usage of this command and highlight important considerations when working with domain names in a Linux environment.

The `domainname` command is a useful tool for managing the domain name of a system, which is a unique identifier for a network or a group of computers. In this lab, we will learn how to check the current domain name, set a new domain name, and ensure that the domain name is persistent across reboots. Additionally, we will discuss how to manage the domain name across different network interfaces, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where a system is connected to multiple networks.
