# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the Linux `domainname` command to display and set the domain name of the system. You explored the basic usage of the command, including checking the current domain name and changing it to a new value. You also learned that the domain name set using the `domainname` command is only valid for the current session, and to make it persistent, you would need to modify the system's network configuration files.
