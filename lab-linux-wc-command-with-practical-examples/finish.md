# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `wc` (word count) command in Linux, which allows you to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. You started by creating a sample text file and using the `wc` command to count the lines, words, and characters in the file. You also explored the different options (`-l`, `-w`, and `-c`) to display only the specific count you're interested in. Additionally, you learned how to use the `wc` command with other Linux commands, such as `ls` and `find`, to count the lines, words, or characters in their output. Finally, you practiced using the `wc` command to count the words, lines, and characters in a file you created.

The lab provided a comprehensive understanding of the `wc` command and its practical applications in Linux. You now have the knowledge to effectively use the `wc` command to analyze text files and the output of other Linux commands.
