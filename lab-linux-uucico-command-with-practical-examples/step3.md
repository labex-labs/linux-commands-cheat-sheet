# Executing uucico for Remote Connection and File Transfer

In this final step, we will execute the `uucico` command to perform a remote connection and file transfer between our local system and the remote system.

First, let's create a file on our local system that we want to transfer to the remote system:

```bash
echo "This is a test file." > ~/project/test_file.txt
```

Now, let's use the `uucico` command to initiate the file transfer:

```bash
sudo uucico -r1 -ssystem -l ~/project/test_file.txt -r ~/project/test_file.txt
```

Here's what the command does:

- `-r1`: Specifies that we want to initiate a remote connection (as opposed to a remote execution).
- `-ssystem`: Specifies the name of the remote system we want to connect to, as defined in the configuration file.
- `-l ~/project/test_file.txt`: Specifies the local file we want to transfer.
- `-r ~/project/test_file.txt`: Specifies the remote path where the file should be transferred.

If the file transfer is successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Connecting to remote_system (192.168.1.100) ...
Logging in as uucp ...
Connected.
Transferring files ...
Sending ~/project/test_file.txt to /home/remote_user/uucp/test_file.txt
Disconnecting.
```

To verify that the file was transferred successfully, you can log in to the remote system and check the `/home/remote_user/uucp` directory for the `test_file.txt` file.
