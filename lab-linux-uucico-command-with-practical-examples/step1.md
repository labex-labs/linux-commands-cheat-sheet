# Introduction to uucico Command

In this step, we will explore the `uucico` command, which is a key component of the Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) protocol, a widely used file transfer and remote execution protocol in the early days of the internet.

The `uucico` command is responsible for establishing and managing remote connections, as well as transferring files between systems using the UUCP protocol. It is typically used in a client-server architecture, where one system (the client) initiates a connection to another system (the server) to perform file transfers or remote command execution.

Let's start by checking the version of `uucico` installed on our system:

```bash
uucico --version
```

Example output:

```
uucico (UUCP) 1.07

Next, we'll take a look at the basic usage of the `uucico` command:

```bash
man uucico
```

This will display the manual page for the `uucico` command, which provides detailed information about its various options and usage.
