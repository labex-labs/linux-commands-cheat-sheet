# Combine col with Other Linux Commands for Advanced Formatting

In this final step, you will learn how to combine the `col` command with other Linux commands to achieve more advanced text formatting and manipulation.

One common use case is to combine `col` with the `sed` command to perform complex text transformations. For example, let's say you have a table of data with some unwanted characters, and you want to clean it up:

```
echo "Name|Age|City" > data.txt
echo "John|25|New York" >> data.txt
echo "Jane|30|Los Angeles" >> data.txt
echo "Bob|35|Chicago" >> data.txt
```

We can use the following command to remove the pipe characters and convert the table to a nicely formatted output:

```
cat data.txt | sed 's/|/\t/g' | col -t
```

Example output:

```
Name    Age     City
John    25      New York
Jane    30      Los Angeles
Bob     35      Chicago
```

In this example, we first use `sed 's/|/\t/g'` to replace all the pipe characters with tabs, and then we use `col -t` to align the columns.

Another example is to combine `col` with the `awk` command to perform more complex data transformations. Let's say you have a table of data with some additional information, and you want to extract and format specific columns:

```
echo "Name,Age,City,Occupation" > data.csv
echo "John,25,New York,Engineer" >> data.csv
echo "Jane,30,Los Angeles,Manager" >> data.csv
echo "Bob,35,Chicago,Accountant" >> data.csv
```

We can use the following command to extract the name, age, and city columns, and format them using `col`:

```
cat data.csv | awk -F',' '{print $1","$2","$3}' | col -t
```

Example output:

```
Name    Age     City
John    25      New York
Jane    30      Los Angeles
Bob     35      Chicago
```

In this example, we use `awk -F','` to split the input line by commas, and then we print the first, second, and third columns. Finally, we use `col -t` to align the columns.

By combining the `col` command with other powerful Linux tools like `sed` and `awk`, you can create advanced text processing and formatting workflows to suit your specific needs.
