# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `setsid` command and learn how to use it to detach a process from the current session and run it in the background. The `setsid` command creates a new session with the calling process as the session leader, allowing the process to run independently without being affected by signals or terminal input/output of the current session. We will start by understanding the `setsid` command and then demonstrate how to use it to run background processes effectively.

The lab covers the following steps:

- Understanding the `setsid` command
- Detaching a process from the current session
- Running background processes with `setsid`

The `setsid` command is a useful tool for managing processes in Linux, and this lab provides practical examples to help you understand and apply it in your daily workflow.
