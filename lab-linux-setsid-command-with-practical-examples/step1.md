# Understanding the setsid Command

In this step, we will explore the `setsid` command in Linux, which is used to detach a process from the current session and run it in the background.

The `setsid` command creates a new session with the calling process as the session leader. This means that the process will be isolated from the current session and will not be affected by signals or terminal input/output of the current session.

Let's start by running a simple command using `setsid`:

```bash
setsid sleep 60
```

This will run the `sleep 60` command in a new session, and the process will continue to run even if you close the current terminal.

Example output:

```
[1] 1234
```

The output shows the process ID (PID) of the `sleep` command, which is running in the background.

Now, let's verify that the process is running in a separate session:

```bash
ps -o sid,pid,cmd | grep sleep
```

Example output:

```
  1234 1234 sleep 60
```

The `ps` command shows that the `sleep` process has a different session ID (SID) than the current session.

In the next step, we will learn how to use `setsid` to run background processes more effectively.
