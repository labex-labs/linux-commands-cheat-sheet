# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and usage of the `whereis` command in Linux. The `whereis` command is a useful tool for locating the executable, source code, and manual pages for a given command or program. You practiced using the `whereis` command to find the location of the `ls` and `gcc` commands, and discovered that it can help you quickly identify the relevant files associated with a program on your system.

Next, you delved deeper into using the `whereis` command to locate executable files, source code, and manual pages for various programs. You explored how the `whereis` command searches for files in a predefined list of standard binary directories, and demonstrated its ability to provide the necessary information to find the relevant files for programs like `gcc`.
