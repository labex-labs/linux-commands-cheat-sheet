# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the `cu` command, which is a powerful tool in Linux for establishing remote connections and transferring files between systems. We learned how to check if the `cu` command is installed on our system and how to install it if necessary.

Next, we focused on establishing a connection using the `cu` command. We covered the syntax for the `cu` command, including the `-l` option to specify the serial device and the `-s` option to specify the baud rate. We also learned how to exit the `cu` session by typing `~.`.
