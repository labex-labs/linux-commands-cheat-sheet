# Introduction to the cu Command

In this step, we will explore the `cu` command, which stands for "Call Up" or "Connect to". The `cu` command is a powerful tool in Linux for establishing remote connections and transferring files between systems. It can be used to connect to other systems, such as mainframes, minicomputers, or other Linux/Unix systems, over a serial line or modem.

To begin, let's first check if the `cu` command is installed on our system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cu
```

Example output:

```

The `cu` command is now installed on our system, and we can start using it to connect to remote systems.
