# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `cu` command, a powerful tool in Linux for establishing remote connections and transferring files between systems. We will learn how to install the `cu` command, establish a connection using it, and transfer files between the local and remote systems. The lab covers the introduction to the `cu` command, establishing a connection, and transferring files with practical examples.

The `cu` command may require additional installation on some systems, as it is not always included by default. Additionally, while the `cu` command is still widely used, there are newer and more feature-rich alternatives available, such as `screen` or `tmux`, which may be more suitable for some use cases.
