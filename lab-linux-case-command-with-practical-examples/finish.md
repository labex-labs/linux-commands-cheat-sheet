# Summary

In this lab, you first learned the syntax and usage of the `case` command in Linux. The `case` command is a powerful tool for making decisions based on the value of a variable or expression. You explored the basic structure of the `case` command and saw an example demonstrating how to use it to check file extensions and perform different actions accordingly. In the second step, you implemented the `case` statement to handle various file extensions in a shell script, automating file operations based on the file type.
