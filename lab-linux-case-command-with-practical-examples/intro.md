# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `case` command to handle different file extensions in a shell script. The lab covers the syntax and usage of the `case` command, demonstrates how to implement `case` statements for file extensions, and shows how to automate backup operations using the `case` command. This lab is designed to help you develop your skills in working with miscellaneous utilities in the Linux environment.

The lab starts by explaining the syntax and usage of the `case` command, which is a powerful tool for making decisions based on the value of a variable or expression. You will learn how to structure the `case` statement and see examples of its practical application.

Next, the lab guides you through the process of implementing `case` statements to handle different file extensions. You will create a shell script that performs various actions based on the file type, such as identifying text documents, PDF files, and images.

Finally, the lab demonstrates how to use the `case` command to automate backup operations. You will learn how to create a script that backs up files with specific extensions to different locations, making it easier to manage and organize your data.
