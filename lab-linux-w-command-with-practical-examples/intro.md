# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `w` command, which provides information about users currently logged into the system and their activities. We will learn how to analyze user login sessions, monitor system load, and utilize various options of the `w` command to gather detailed insights about the system's performance and user behavior. Understanding the `w` command is essential for effective system monitoring and management on Linux systems.
