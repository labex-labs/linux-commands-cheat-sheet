# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `procinfo` command, which is a powerful tool for monitoring system information. The lab covers the basics of the `procinfo` command, including how to monitor system information such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Additionally, we will learn how to customize the `procinfo` output to focus on specific system information. This lab is designed to provide a practical understanding of system monitoring and management using the `procinfo` command.

The `procinfo` command is not installed by default on some Linux distributions, so you may need to install the `procinfo` package before using it. Additionally, the `procinfo` command is considered outdated and may not be available in newer Linux distributions, in which case you may want to consider using alternative tools like `htop` or `top` for system monitoring.
