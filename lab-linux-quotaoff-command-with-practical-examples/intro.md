# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to manage disk quotas in Linux, which is a mechanism to limit the amount of disk space and the number of files that a user or a group can consume on a file system. You will start by understanding the concept of disk quotas, then enable them on a Linux file system, and finally use the `quotaoff` command to disable the quotas. The lab covers the necessary steps to create quota files, assign quotas to users and groups, and manage the overall quota system.
