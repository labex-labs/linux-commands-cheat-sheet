# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `od` (octal dump) command in Linux, which is used to display the contents of a file in various formats, including octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. You created sample files with text and binary data, and explored the different options available with the `od` command to customize the output format. You learned how to use the `-t` option to specify the desired output format, such as 1-byte octal, 1-byte hexadecimal, and character (ASCII) format. Additionally, you discovered how to combine multiple options to further customize the output.
