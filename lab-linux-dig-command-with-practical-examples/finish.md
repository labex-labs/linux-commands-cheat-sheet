# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and basic syntax of the `dig` command, which is a powerful tool for performing DNS (Domain Name System) queries and troubleshooting network issues. You performed basic DNS lookups using `dig` to obtain domain name to IP address mappings and explored advanced `dig` options for obtaining detailed DNS information, such as using the `@server` option to specify the DNS server to use for the query, the `+trace` option to perform a recursive query, and the `+short` option to display a shortened version of the output.
