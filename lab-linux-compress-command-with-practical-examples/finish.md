# Summary

In this lab, we first introduced the Linux `compress` command, which is used to compress and decompress files using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. We learned how to check the version of the `compress` command and how to use it to compress and decompress files. We then explored more advanced options of the `compress` command, such as compressing and decompressing files with different file extensions and using various compression levels.
