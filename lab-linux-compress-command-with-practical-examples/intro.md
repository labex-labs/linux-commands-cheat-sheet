# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `compress` command, which is used to compress and decompress files. The `compress` command is a classic compression utility that uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. We will start by introducing the `compress` command, then demonstrate how to compress and decompress files using it, and finally explore some advanced options of the command.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Introduce the Linux `compress` command
2. Compress and decompress files using the `compress` command
3. Explore advanced options of the `compress` command
