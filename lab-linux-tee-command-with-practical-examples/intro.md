# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `tee` command in Linux, which allows you to redirect the output of a command to both a file and the terminal simultaneously. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `tee` command, as well as practical examples of redirecting command output and appending to existing files. The `tee` command is a versatile tool that is particularly useful when you want to view the output of a command while also saving it to a file for future reference.

The lab also demonstrates how to use the `-a` option to append the output to an existing file instead of overwriting it. This can be helpful when you want to gradually build up a log or record of command outputs over time.
