# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `tee` command in Linux, which allows you to redirect the output of a command to both a file and the terminal simultaneously. You also learned how to use the `tee` command to redirect the output to a file and the terminal, as well as how to append the output to an existing file instead of overwriting it. The `tee` command is a versatile tool that can be particularly useful when you need to view the output of a command while also saving it to a file for future reference.
