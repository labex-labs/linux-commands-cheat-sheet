# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `zless` command in Linux, which allows you to view the contents of compressed files without having to decompress them first. The `zless` command is particularly useful when working with large compressed files, as it enables you to quickly browse through the contents without consuming a significant amount of disk space or memory. You will explore the syntax and options of the `zless` command, and learn how to use it in practical examples, such as viewing the contents of compressed log files or backup archives.
