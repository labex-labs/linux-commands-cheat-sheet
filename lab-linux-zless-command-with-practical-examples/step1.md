# Understand the Purpose of the zless Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and use of the `zless` command in Linux. The `zless` command is a powerful tool that allows you to view the contents of compressed files without having to decompress them first.

The `zless` command is particularly useful when working with large compressed files, as it enables you to quickly browse through the contents without consuming a significant amount of disk space or memory. This makes it an efficient way to inspect the contents of compressed files, such as log files or backup archives, without the need to decompress the entire file.

To get started, let's explore the basic syntax of the `zless` command:

```
zless [compressed_file]
```

Here, `[compressed_file]` is the name of the compressed file you want to view.

Example:

```
zless example.txt.gz
```

This will allow you to view the contents of the `example.txt.gz` file without decompressing it.
