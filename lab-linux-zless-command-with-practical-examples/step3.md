# Practical Examples of Using the zless Command

In this final step, you will explore some practical examples of using the `zless` command to work with compressed files.

1. **Viewing a Compressed Log File**:

   ```
   zless system.log.gz
   ```

   This will allow you to view the contents of the `system.log.gz` file without decompressing it.

2. **Searching for a Pattern in a Compressed File**:

   ```
   zless -p "error" application.log.gz
   ```

   This will search for the word "error" within the `application.log.gz` file and display the matching lines.

3. **Viewing a Compressed Manual Page**:

   ```
   zless /usr/share/man/man1/zless.1.gz
   ```

   This will display the manual page for the `zless` command, which is stored in a compressed file.

4. **Viewing a Compressed Backup Archive**:
   ```
   zless backup.tar.gz
   ```
   This will allow you to browse the contents of the `backup.tar.gz` file without decompressing the entire archive.

Remember, the `zless` command is particularly useful when working with large compressed files, as it enables you to quickly inspect the contents without consuming a significant amount of disk space or memory.
