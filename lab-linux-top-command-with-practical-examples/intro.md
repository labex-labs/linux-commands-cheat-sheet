# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux top command, a powerful tool for monitoring system performance and resource utilization. We will start by understanding the basic functionality of the top command, including its ability to display real-time information about running processes, CPU, memory, and other system resources. We will then dive into the various options and customizations available to tailor the top command's output to our specific needs, enabling us to effectively analyze system performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
