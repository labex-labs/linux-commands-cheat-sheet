# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the top command, a powerful tool for monitoring system performance and resource utilization in Linux. We explored the various system information displayed by the top command, including uptime, task statistics, CPU and memory usage, and a list of the most resource-intensive processes. We also discovered how to customize the top command's output by using different keys, such as toggling between per-CPU and aggregate CPU utilization, managing the displayed columns, and customizing the sort order of the process list.
