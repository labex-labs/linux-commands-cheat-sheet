# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux quotacheck command and its practical applications. The lab covers the installation of the quota package on Ubuntu 22.04, enabling quota on a filesystem, and using the quotacheck command to check quota information. This lab is designed to help system administrators manage disk quotas, which allow them to limit the amount of disk space and number of inodes that individual users or groups can consume.
