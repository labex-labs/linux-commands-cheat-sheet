# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the quota package on Ubuntu 22.04, which provides tools to manage disk quotas and limit the amount of disk space and number of inodes that individual users or groups can consume. We then enabled quota on a filesystem and used the quotacheck command to check quota information. The steps covered the installation process, enabling quota, and using the quotacheck command to examine quota data.
