# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `dos2unix` command to convert text files from the DOS/Windows format to the Unix/Linux format. The `dos2unix` command is a simple and effective tool that removes the carriage return characters and ensures compatibility when transferring files between Windows and Unix-like systems. You will also explore how to automate the conversion process using shell scripts. The `dos2unix` command is part of the `tofrodos` package, which is already installed in your Ubuntu 22.04 environment.
