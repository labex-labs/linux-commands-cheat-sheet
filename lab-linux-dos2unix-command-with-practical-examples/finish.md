# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the dos2unix command, which is used to convert text files from the DOS/Windows format to the Unix/Linux format. You created a sample text file in the DOS format and used the dos2unix command to convert it to the Unix format. You also learned how to automate the dos2unix conversion process using shell scripts.

The dos2unix command is a simple and effective tool to address the issue of line ending differences between Windows and Unix-like systems. It removes the carriage return characters and converts the file to the Unix format. You explored the usage of the dos2unix command and verified the contents of the converted file.
