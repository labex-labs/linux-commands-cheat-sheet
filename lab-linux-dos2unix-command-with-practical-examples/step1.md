# Introduction to the dos2unix Command

In this step, you will learn about the `dos2unix` command, which is used to convert text files from the DOS/Windows format to the Unix/Linux format.

The DOS/Windows format uses the carriage return and line feed (CR+LF) characters to indicate the end of a line, while the Unix/Linux format uses only the line feed (LF) character. This difference can cause issues when transferring files between Windows and Unix-like systems.

The `dos2unix` command is a simple and effective tool to address this problem. It reads the input file, removes the carriage return characters, and writes the modified content to the output file.

Let's start by checking the version of the `dos2unix` command installed on your system:

```bash
dos2unix --version
```

Example output:

```
