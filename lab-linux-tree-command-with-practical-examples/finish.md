# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and basic usage of the `tree` command in Linux. The `tree` command is a powerful tool that displays the directory structure in a tree-like format, making it easier to visualize and navigate the file system. You explored how to install the `tree` command and use it to display the contents of the current working directory or a specific directory. Additionally, you learned about various options, such as displaying file sizes and showing only the directory structure without the files, to customize the output of the `tree` command.
