# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `split` command to divide a file into smaller, more manageable pieces. The `split` command is a powerful tool that can be used to split files by line count or by byte size, making it useful for working with large files or distributing files across multiple systems. You will start by understanding the purpose and syntax of the `split` command, and then explore practical examples of splitting files using both line count and byte size options.

The lab covers the following steps:
1. Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the `split` Command
2. Split a File into Multiple Parts by Line Count
3. Split a File into Multiple Parts by Byte Size

The `split` command is a standard Linux utility, and no additional installation is required.
