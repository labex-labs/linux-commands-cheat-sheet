# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `split` command to divide a large file into smaller, more manageable parts. The `split` command is a powerful tool that allows you to split files based on size, line count, or other criteria, making it useful for working with large log files, database backups, or other types of data that need to be processed or transferred in smaller pieces. You will start by understanding the purpose of the `split` command, then learn how to customize the command options to split a file into multiple parts. This lab provides practical examples to help you become proficient in using the `split` command for your text processing and editing needs.
