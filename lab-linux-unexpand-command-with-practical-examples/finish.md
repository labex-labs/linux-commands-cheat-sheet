# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `unexpand` command in Linux. The `unexpand` command is used to convert spaces in the input to tabs, which can be helpful when working with text-based data that is often easier to read and manipulate when it is tab-separated. You also learned how to use the `unexpand` command to convert tabs to spaces, which can be useful when working with text files that need to be formatted with consistent spacing.

The `unexpand` command can be further customized with additional options, which you will explore in the next step.
