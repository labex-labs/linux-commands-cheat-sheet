# Expand Tabs to Spaces Using the unexpand Command

In this step, you will learn how to use the `unexpand` command to convert tabs to spaces in a text file.

While the `unexpand` command is typically used to convert spaces to tabs, it can also be used in the opposite direction to expand tabs to spaces. This can be useful when working with text files that need to be formatted with consistent spacing, such as when preparing data for further processing or analysis.

Let's start by creating a sample text file with tabs:

```
$ cat sample.txt
This	is	a	sample	text	file	with	tabs.
```

Now, let's use the `unexpand` command with the `-a` (or `--all`) option to convert the tabs to spaces:

```
$ unexpand -a sample.txt
This    is      a       sample  text    file    with    tabs.
```

As you can see, the `unexpand -a` command has replaced the tabs with the appropriate number of spaces to maintain the alignment of the text.

Example output:

```
This    is      a       sample  text    file    with    tabs.
```

The `-a` (or `--all`) option ensures that all tabs are converted to spaces, even if they are not aligned in the input. This can be useful when working with text files that have inconsistent tab spacing.
