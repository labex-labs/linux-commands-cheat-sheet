# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and usage of the agetty command, which manages the user login process on the system's virtual consoles or serial ports. We learned that agetty is responsible for displaying the login prompt, handling the user login process, initializing the terminal settings, and launching the user's shell after a successful login.

Next, we configured agetty to enable serial console access on our system. We created a new systemd service file for the serial console, which sets up agetty to listen on the serial port and handle the login process for serial console users.
