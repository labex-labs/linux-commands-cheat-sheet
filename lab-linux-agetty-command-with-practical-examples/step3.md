# Manage User Login Processes with agetty

In this final step, we will explore how to manage user login processes using the `agetty` command.

First, let's create a new user account that we can use to test the login process:

```bash
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
```

This will create a new user account named "testuser" and set a password for the account.

Next, we can use the `agetty` command to simulate a user login process. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo agetty --login-program /bin/login --autologin testuser tty1
```

This command will start an `agetty` process that automatically logs in the "testuser" account on the `tty1` virtual console.

You can now switch to the `tty1` console (usually accessed by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1) and you should see the user logged in as "testuser".

To terminate the `agetty` process, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where you ran the `agetty` command.
