# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the stat Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `stat` command in Linux. The `stat` command is used to display detailed information about a file or directory, including its metadata such as permissions, ownership, timestamps, and more.

To use the `stat` command, simply run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
stat [options] <file_or_directory>
```

The most commonly used options for the `stat` command are:

- `-c` or `--format=<format>`: Specify the output format using a custom format string.
- `-L` or `--dereference`: Follow symbolic links and display information about the target file or directory.
- `-f` or `--file-system`: Display information about the file system instead of the file itself.

Here's an example of using the `stat` command to get information about a file:

```bash
stat ~/project/example.txt
```

Example output:

```
  File: '/home/labex/project/example.txt'
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
Device: 801h/2049d	Inode: 131074      Links: 1

```

This output provides detailed information about the file, including its size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
