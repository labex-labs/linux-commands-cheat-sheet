# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `resize` command and learn how to resize partitions and logical volumes. The `resize` command is a powerful tool for managing storage space on your Linux system. We will start by understanding the basic syntax and usage of the `resize` command, and then proceed to resize a partition and an LVM (Logical Volume Management) volume group and logical volume using practical examples.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `resize` command
2. Resize a partition using the `resize` command
3. Resize an LVM volume group and logical volume

Remember, the `resize` command should be used with caution, as resizing partitions or logical volumes can potentially lead to data loss if not done correctly. Always ensure that you have a backup of your data before performing any resize operations.
