# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the Apache HTTP Server on Ubuntu 22.04, start, stop, and restart the server, and configure Apache virtual hosts. We first updated the package index and then installed the Apache HTTP Server package. We then explored commands to manage the Apache service, such as starting, stopping, and restarting it. Finally, we configured Apache virtual hosts to host multiple websites on the same server.
