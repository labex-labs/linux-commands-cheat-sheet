# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux mingetty command and learned how to configure it for automatic login. We first understood the purpose and usage of the mingetty command, which is a lightweight alternative to the standard getty program used for managing virtual terminals. We then configured mingetty to enable automatic login, which is a useful feature for scenarios where the system is intended for a single user or in kiosk-style applications. By modifying the mingetty configuration file, we were able to set up automatic login for the 'labex' user.
