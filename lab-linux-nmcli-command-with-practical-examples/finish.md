# Summary

In this lab, we were introduced to the powerful `nmcli` command, which is a command-line tool for managing network connections in Linux. We learned how to check the version of `nmcli` installed on our system and explored the key features of this tool, including viewing and managing network connections, configuring network interfaces, connecting to and disconnecting from networks, and troubleshooting network issues.

We then delved into the process of configuring network interfaces using `nmcli`. We learned how to list all available network interfaces, create a new Ethernet connection, and activate the connection. These skills are essential for effectively managing network settings in a Linux environment.
