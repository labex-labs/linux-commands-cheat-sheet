# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the fbset command, which is used to set and display the frame buffer device parameters. We learned how to check the current frame buffer device information, list all the available frame buffer modes, and understand the output of these commands.

Next, we focused on adjusting the screen resolution and depth using the fbset command. We checked the available screen resolutions, and then demonstrated how to change the screen resolution to 800x600 and the color depth to 32-bit. Finally, we customized the display settings by modifying the frame buffer mode parameters, such as the geometry, timings, and color depth.
