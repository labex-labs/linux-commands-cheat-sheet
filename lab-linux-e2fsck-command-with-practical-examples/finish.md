# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `e2fsck` command in Linux. The `e2fsck` command is used to check and repair the Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4 file systems, which are commonly used file systems in Linux-based operating systems. It can be used to check for file system corruption, recover lost files, and optimize file system performance. You then practiced using the `e2fsck` command to check and repair a corrupted Ext4 file system by intentionally modifying the superblock and then using the `e2fsck` command to fix the issues.
