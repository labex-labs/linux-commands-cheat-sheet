# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `dirs` command in Linux, which is used to display the contents of the directory stack - a list of directories you have navigated to during your current shell session. You explored different options for the `dirs` command, such as `-l` to display full paths, `-p` to show one directory per line, and `-v` to display the stack with line numbers. Additionally, you learned how to manage the directory stack using the `pushd` and `popd` commands, which allow you to add and remove directories from the stack, respectively.
