# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `dirs` command in Linux to manage and explore the directory stack, which is a list of directories that you have navigated to during your current shell session. You will also learn how to use the `pushd` and `popd` commands to manipulate the directory stack. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `dirs` command, as well as practical examples of how to use it to display and manage the directory stack.

The lab consists of three main steps: understanding the purpose and syntax of the `dirs` command, exploring the directory stack using the `dirs` command, and managing the directory stack with the `pushd` and `popd` commands. Throughout the lab, you will practice using the `dirs` command with various options to display the contents of the directory stack in different formats.
