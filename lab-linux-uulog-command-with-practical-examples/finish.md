# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the uulog command in Linux. The uulog command is a utility that allows you to view and search the system log files, which are typically stored in the /var/log directory. You explored the available options for the uulog command, such as displaying all log entries, filtering by priority level, and viewing log entries from a specific date and time or associated with a particular user. Additionally, you learned how to use the uulog command to view the contents of the default system log file, /var/log/syslog, and follow the log file to continuously display new entries as they are added.
