# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `locale` command and its practical applications. We will first understand the concept of locales, which define the language, country, character encoding, and other cultural preferences used by applications and the operating system. Then, we will explore the available locales on the system and learn how to list them. Finally, we will change the system locale and observe the impact on the system's behavior. This lab will provide you with a solid understanding of how to manage and customize the locale settings in a Linux environment.
