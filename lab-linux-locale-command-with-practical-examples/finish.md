# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the concept of locales in Linux, which are settings that define the language, country, character encoding, and other cultural preferences used by applications and the operating system. We then learned how to check the current locale settings on the system and understand the information provided. Next, we explored the available locales on the system by listing all the installed locales, and we discussed the format of the locale names. Finally, we learned how to change the system locale and observe the impact on the display of information.
