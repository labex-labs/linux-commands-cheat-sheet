# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `logname` command and its practical applications for system monitoring and management. The `logname` command is used to display the current user's login name, which can be useful for various purposes, such as logging, user-specific configurations, or access control.

We will start by understanding the purpose of the `logname` command and how it retrieves the login name from the `LOGNAME` environment variable. Then, we will examine the syntax and available options of the command, as well as its compatibility across different Linux and Unix-like systems. Finally, we will go through several practical examples of using the `logname` command in real-world scenarios.
