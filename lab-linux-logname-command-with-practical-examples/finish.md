# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the `logname` command in Linux, which is used to display the current user's login name. We learned that the command retrieves the login name by checking the value of the `LOGNAME` environment variable, which is set by the system when a user logs in. The `logname` command is often used in shell scripts or other automation tasks to get the current user's login name, which can be useful for various purposes such as logging, user-specific configurations, or access control. We then explored the syntax and available options of the `logname` command, noting that it does not have any optional arguments or flags, but that the output may be affected by the `LOGNAME` environment variable and the compatibility of the command on different systems.
