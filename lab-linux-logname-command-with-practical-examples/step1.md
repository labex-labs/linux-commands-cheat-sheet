# Understand the Purpose of the logname Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `logname` command in Linux. The `logname` command is used to display the current user's login name. It is a simple yet useful command that can be used for system monitoring and management tasks.

To use the `logname` command, simply run the following in the terminal:

```bash
logname
```

Example output:

```
labex
```

The output shows the current user's login name, which in this case is `labex`.

The `logname` command retrieves the login name of the current user by checking the value of the `LOGNAME` environment variable. This variable is set by the system when a user logs in and contains the user's login name.

The `logname` command is often used in shell scripts or other automation tasks to get the current user's login name. This information can be useful for various purposes, such as logging, user-specific configurations, or access control.
