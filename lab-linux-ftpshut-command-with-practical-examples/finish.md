# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `ftpshut` command in Linux to gracefully shut down the FTP server. The `ftpshut` command allows you to prevent new connections to the FTP server and allow existing connections to complete before the server is shut down. We also explored how to schedule an automatic FTP server shutdown and set a custom shutdown message.

Finally, we learned how to check the status of the FTP server and use the `ftpshut` command to immediately shut down the server.
