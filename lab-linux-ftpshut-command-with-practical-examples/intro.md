# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `ftpshut` command, which is used to gracefully shut down the FTP server. We will learn how to shut down the FTP server, prevent new connections, and allow existing connections to complete before the server is shut down. Additionally, we will cover how to schedule automatic FTP server shutdown. The lab covers practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you master the `ftpshut` command.
