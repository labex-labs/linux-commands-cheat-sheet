# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `rmt` command, which stands for "remote magnetic tape." The `rmt` command is used to control remote magnetic tape drives over a network connection, allowing you to perform remote backups and restores. We will learn how to use the `rmt` command in conjunction with the `tar` command to backup and restore files across a network, as well as how to automate the backup process using a Cron job.

The lab will cover the following steps: Introduction to the `rmt` command, Backup and Restore Files Using `rmt`, and Automating Backup with `rmt` in a Cron Job. The `rmt` command is typically used for managing remote tape drives, but it can also be used with other storage media like disk or network-attached storage.
