# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `rmt` command, which is used to control remote magnetic tape drives over a network connection. We learned how to check the version of the `rmt` command and use it in conjunction with the `tar` command to perform remote backups and restores. Specifically, we created a sample file, backed it up to a remote server using the `rmt` command, and then restored the file from the remote backup. The lab provided a practical understanding of how to leverage the `rmt` command for efficient file management across a network.
