# Introduction to the rmt Command

In this step, we will explore the `rmt` command, which stands for "remote magnetic tape," in the Linux operating system. The `rmt` command is used to control remote magnetic tape drives over a network connection.

First, let's check the version of the `rmt` command installed on our system:

```bash
rmt --version
```

Example output:

```

The `rmt` command is typically used in conjunction with the `tar` command to perform remote backups and restores. It allows you to control a remote tape drive as if it were local, making it easier to manage backups across a network.

In the next step, we will learn how to use the `rmt` command to backup and restore files.
