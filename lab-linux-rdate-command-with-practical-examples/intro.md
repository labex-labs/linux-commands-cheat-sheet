# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `rdate` command to synchronize your Linux system's time with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. The lab covers understanding the `rdate` command, synchronizing the system time with a remote NTP server, and automating the time synchronization process using Cron. This lab is designed to help you manage and maintain accurate system time on your Linux-based systems.

The lab starts by explaining the `rdate` command and how it can be used to set the system clock by retrieving the current time from a remote NTP server. You will then learn how to synchronize your system's time with a remote NTP server, such as `time.nist.gov`, and verify the updated time. Finally, the lab covers automating the time synchronization process using Cron, a time-based job scheduler, to ensure your system's clock remains accurate.
