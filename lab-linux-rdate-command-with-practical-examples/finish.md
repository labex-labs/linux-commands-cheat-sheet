# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `rdate` command, which is used to synchronize the system time with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. You first understood the basic usage of the `rdate` command, including how to set the system clock using a remote NTP server like `time.nist.gov`. You then learned how to verify the updated system time using the `date` command. Additionally, you explored the alternative `ntpdate` command for synchronizing the system time with an NTP server.
