# Summary

In this lab, we explored the cfdisk command, a powerful tool for partitioning and managing disk drives in Linux. We learned how to check the available disk devices using the lsblk command, launch the cfdisk utility, and navigate through its interactive interface. We also discovered how to create, delete, and modify disk partitions using the various options and function keys provided by cfdisk. Finally, we learned the importance of being cautious when making changes to the disk to avoid accidentally deleting or modifying important data.
