# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the `sync` command in Linux, which is used to synchronize data between memory and storage devices. We learned that the `sync` command forces the operating system to write all buffered modifications to the disk, ensuring that the data on the disk is up-to-date. This is important in various scenarios, such as before shutting down or rebooting the system, unmounting a file system, or performing a backup or snapshot operation.

Next, we demonstrated how to use the `sync` command to synchronize file system data. We created a new file, made changes to it, and then used the `sync` command to ensure that the changes were written to the disk. This helps to maintain the integrity and reliability of the file system data.
