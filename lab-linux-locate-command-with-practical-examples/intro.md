# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `locate` command to quickly search for files and directories on your system. The `locate` command uses a pre-built database to perform fast searches, making it more efficient than the `find` command, especially for large file systems.

You will start by installing the `mlocate` package, which provides the `locate` command and maintains the database of file locations. Then, you will explore practical examples of using the `locate` command to search for files and directories, including the use of wildcards for more complex searches.
