# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the `aplaymidi` command, a Linux utility for playing MIDI files. We explored how to display the available MIDI devices on the system and how to use the `aplaymidi` command to play a MIDI file by specifying the target MIDI device. We then delved deeper into playing MIDI files using `aplaymidi`, covering the basic command structure and options to select the appropriate MIDI device for playback. Finally, we explored advanced `aplaymidi` options, such as controlling the playback volume and looping the MIDI file.
