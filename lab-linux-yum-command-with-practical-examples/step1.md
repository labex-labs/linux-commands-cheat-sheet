# Introduction to yum Package Manager

In this step, we will explore the yum package manager, which is a powerful tool for managing software packages on Red Hat-based Linux distributions, including CentOS, Fedora, and RHEL.

First, let's check the current version of yum installed on our system:

```bash
yum --version
```

Example output:

```
4.4.2
```

The yum package manager provides several key features:

1. **Installing Packages**: You can use yum to install new software packages on your system.
2. **Updating Packages**: yum can be used to update installed packages to their latest versions.
3. **Removing Packages**: Packages can be removed using the yum command.
4. **Searching for Packages**: You can search for available packages using yum.
5. **Checking for Package Updates**: yum can check for and notify you of available package updates.

Now, let's try some basic yum commands to get a better understanding of how it works.
