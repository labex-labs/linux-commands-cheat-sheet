# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the yum package manager, a powerful tool for managing software packages on Red Hat-based Linux distributions. We will learn how to install, update, and remove packages using yum, as well as search for available packages and check for updates.

First, we will introduce the yum package manager, its key features, and check the current version installed on our system. Then, we will demonstrate how to install new packages, update existing ones, and remove packages using various yum commands. This lab provides practical examples and step-by-step guidance to help you become proficient in managing packages on your Linux system.
