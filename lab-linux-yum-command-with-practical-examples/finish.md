# Summary

In this lab, we explored the yum package manager, a powerful tool for managing software packages on Red Hat-based Linux distributions. We learned how to check the current version of yum installed on our system, and the key features of the yum package manager, including installing, updating, and removing packages, as well as searching for and checking for available package updates. We then practiced installing a new package, the "tree" package, using the yum command.
