# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and syntax of the `fc-list` command in Linux, which is used to list all available fonts on the system and filter them by family, style, and other attributes. We learned how to use the `fc-list` command to display a list of all installed fonts, including the font file path, font family name, and font style. We also discussed how to use additional options with the `fc-list` command to get more detailed information about the fonts on the system.
