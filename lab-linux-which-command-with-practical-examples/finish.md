In this lab, you learned about the purpose and usage of the `which` command in Linux. The `which` command is used to locate the path of executable files in the system by searching through the directories specified in the `PATH` environment variable. You explored how to use the `which` command to find the location of various commands, such as `ls`, `python`, `git`, and `nano`. Additionally, you learned how to use the `which` command to locate the path of a custom script you created, demonstrating its usefulness in identifying the location of executable files on your system.
