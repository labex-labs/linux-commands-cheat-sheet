# Explore Advanced Usage of the which Command

In this final step, you will explore some advanced usage scenarios of the `which` command.

One advanced use case is to use the `which` command to find the first occurrence of an executable in your `PATH`. For example, let's say you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, and you want to find the first one in your `PATH`:

```bash
which python
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/python3
```

The `which` command will return the first instance of the `python` executable it finds in your `PATH`.

You can also use the `which` command with the `-a` option to list all the occurrences of an executable in your `PATH`:

```bash
which -a python
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/python3.10
/usr/bin/python
```

This can be useful when you have multiple versions of the same command installed and want to see all the available options.

Another advanced usage is to use the `which` command to check if a command exists in your `PATH`. You can do this by checking the exit code of the `which` command:

```bash
which non_existent_command
echo $?
```

Example output:

```
echo $?
1
```

If the command is not found in your `PATH`, the `which` command will return a non-zero exit code, indicating that the command does not exist.

These advanced techniques can be helpful when working with complex system environments or when you need to troubleshoot issues related to executable file locations.
