# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mkswap` command, which is used to set up a swap area on a disk partition or in a file. Swap space is an essential component of the operating system, providing temporary storage when physical RAM memory is full. In this lab, we will learn how to create a swap file, initialize it using the `mkswap` command, and then enable and verify its usage. This lab covers the key steps to effectively manage swap space in a Linux system.

The lab consists of three main steps: understanding the purpose of the `mkswap` command, creating a swap file using the `mkswap` command, and enabling the swap file and verifying its usage. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to set up and manage swap space in your Linux environment.
