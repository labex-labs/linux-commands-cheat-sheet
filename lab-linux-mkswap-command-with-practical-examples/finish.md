# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the `mkswap` command in Linux, which is used to set up a swap area on a disk partition or in a file. We then learned how to create a 2GB swap file using the `dd` and `mkswap` commands, and finally, we enabled the swap file and verified its usage.

After completing these steps, we now have a better understanding of how to manage swap space on a Linux system, which can be useful for improving system performance when physical memory is limited.
