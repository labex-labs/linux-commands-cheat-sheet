# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `dirname` command in Linux, which is used to extract the directory name from a given file path. You practiced using the `dirname` command with file paths, variables, and other Linux commands to retrieve the directory name. You also learned how to combine the `dirname` command with other commands to perform more complex operations on file paths.

The key learning points from this lab include understanding the basic syntax of the `dirname` command, using it to extract the directory name from a file path, and integrating it with other Linux commands to automate common tasks related to file and directory management.
