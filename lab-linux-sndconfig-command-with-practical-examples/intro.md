# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `sndconfig` command, which is used to configure sound card settings. The `sndconfig` command is a legacy tool that has been deprecated in modern Linux distributions, but it can still be useful for troubleshooting sound-related issues.

We will start by understanding the `sndconfig` command, including its available options and how to list the sound cards on the system. Then, we will guide you through the process of configuring the sound card settings using the interactive `sndconfig` configuration wizard. Finally, we will cover how to troubleshoot sound issues with the `sndconfig` command.
