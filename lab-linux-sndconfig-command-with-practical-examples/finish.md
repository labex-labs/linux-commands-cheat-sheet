# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the `sndconfig` command in Linux, which is used to configure sound card settings. We learned that `sndconfig` is a legacy tool that has been deprecated in modern Linux distributions, but it can still be useful for troubleshooting sound-related issues. We then used the `sndconfig` command to configure the sound card settings on our system, following the interactive configuration wizard to select the sound card, adjust the volume levels, and test the sound output.
