# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the importance of automatic updates for Linux systems. Automatic updates provide crucial security, stability, and feature enhancements, ensuring your system is up-to-date and protected. We then configured automatic updates on an Ubuntu 22.04 system using the `unattended-upgrades` package, which allows the system to automatically download and install security patches and other important updates without user intervention.
