# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the dnf (Dandified YUM) command, which is the default package manager for modern Red Hat-based Linux distributions. You explored how to use dnf to install new packages, update existing packages, search for packages, and manage package groups and dependencies. Specifically, you learned how to check the current version of dnf, search for packages, install the "tree" package, and update all installed packages on the system.
