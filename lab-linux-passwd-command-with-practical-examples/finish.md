# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Linux `passwd` command to manage user passwords. We started by understanding the `passwd` command and checking the current user's password status. Then, we learned how to change the password for a specific user account, and finally, we explored the process of resetting a forgotten password. The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of password management in a Linux system.
