# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `passwd` command, which is used to change user passwords. We will learn how to check the current user's password status, change the password for a specific user account, and reset the password for a user account when the user has forgotten their password. The `passwd` command is a fundamental tool for managing user accounts and security in a Linux system.

The lab covers the following steps:

- Understanding the `passwd` command
- Changing user password
- Resetting forgotten password
