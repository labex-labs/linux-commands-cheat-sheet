# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `cal` command in Linux. The `cal` command is used to display a calendar for the current month, a specific month, or a specific year. You can display the calendar for the current month by simply running the `cal` command. To display the calendar for a specific month and year, you can use the syntax `cal [month] [year]`. The `cal` command can also display the calendar for a full year by specifying only the year.
