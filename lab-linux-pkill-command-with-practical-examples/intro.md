# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `pkill` command to terminate processes by their name or process ID (PID). The `pkill` command is a powerful tool for managing processes in a Linux system, as it provides a convenient way to kill processes without having to know their exact PIDs. You will explore how to terminate processes by name, as well as how to terminate processes by their PID. The lab covers practical examples and demonstrates the versatility of the `pkill` command in process management tasks.
