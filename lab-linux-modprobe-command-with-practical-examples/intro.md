# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `modprobe` command and its practical applications. The `modprobe` command is used to load and remove kernel modules, which are essential components that extend the functionality of the Linux kernel. We will understand the purpose of the `modprobe` command, learn how to load and remove kernel modules using it, and explore its benefits over lower-level commands like `insmod` and `rmmod`. The lab will provide a comprehensive understanding of managing kernel modules in Linux, which is a crucial skill for system administrators and developers.
