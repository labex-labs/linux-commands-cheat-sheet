# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the acpid (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface daemon) command in Linux. The acpid command is responsible for monitoring and responding to various power-related events, such as laptop lid closing, system suspend/resume, and power button presses. You will configure acpid to monitor power events and create custom event handlers to customize the system's behavior based on these events. This lab provides practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and utilize the acpid command effectively.
