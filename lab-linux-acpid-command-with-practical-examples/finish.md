# Summary

In this lab, we explored the acpid (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface daemon) command and its purpose in Linux systems. We learned that acpid is responsible for monitoring and responding to various power-related events, such as laptop lid closing, system suspend/resume, and power button presses. We also examined the default event handlers provided by the acpid service and understood how to customize these event handlers or create new ones to suit our specific needs.

Next, we will configure acpid to monitor power events and create custom event handlers to automate system behavior based on these events.
