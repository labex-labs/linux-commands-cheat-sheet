# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `mkfs.minix` command, which is used to create a Minix file system on a block device. Minix is a compact and lightweight file system, often used in embedded systems or resource-constrained environments. We will learn how to create a Minix file system, mount it, and interact with it by creating files and directories. The lab covers the introduction to the `mkfs.minix` command, creating a Minix file system, and mounting and interacting with the Minix file system.
