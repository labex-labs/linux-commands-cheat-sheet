# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `mkfs.minix` command, which is used to create a Minix file system on a block device. We first created a loopback device and then used the `mkfs.minix` command to initialize the Minix file system on it. After that, we mounted the Minix file system and created files and directories within it, verifying the contents using the `ls` command.

The key learning points from this lab include the usage of the `mkfs.minix` command to create a Minix file system, the process of mounting and interacting with the file system, and the commands to create and manage files and directories within the Minix file system.
