# Summary

In this lab, we explored the ntsysv command, a powerful tool for configuring and managing system services in Linux. We learned how to use the ntsysv command to navigate through the list of available system services and toggle their status using a text-based user interface. We also discussed how to manage runlevels using ntsysv, which allows us to control the services that start at different system boot levels.
