The lab covers understanding the purpose and syntax of the `mdu` command, measuring the disk usage of a directory, and excluding specific files and directories from the `mdu` command. This will help you effectively manage disk space and understand the storage requirements of your Linux environment.

The lab provides step-by-step instructions and practical examples to guide you through the process. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to utilize the `mdu` command to monitor and optimize disk usage on your Linux system.
