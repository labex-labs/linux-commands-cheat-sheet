# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `mdu` command in Linux, which is used to measure the disk usage of directories and files. You explored the basic syntax of the `mdu` command, including the available options such as `-h` to display the disk usage in human-readable format, `-s` to display the total size of a directory, and `-x` to exclude directories on different file systems. You also learned how to use the `mdu` command to measure the disk usage of a directory, creating a sample directory and files to test the command.
