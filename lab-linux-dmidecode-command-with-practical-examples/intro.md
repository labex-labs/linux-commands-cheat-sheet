# Introduction

In this lab, we will introduce the dmidecode command, a powerful tool for retrieving detailed hardware information on Linux systems. The dmidecode command can display a wide range of hardware details, including system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, processor information, and memory configuration. We will start by installing the dmidecode package and then use the command to explore the system's hardware specifications. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to extract specific hardware details, such as processor information, using dmidecode.
