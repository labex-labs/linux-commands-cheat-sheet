# Summary

In this lab, we introduced the `dmidecode` command, a powerful tool for retrieving detailed hardware information on Linux systems. We learned that `dmidecode` can display a wide range of hardware details, including system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, processor information, and memory configuration. We also explored how to use the `dmidecode` command to extract specific hardware details, such as processor information. The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help users understand and utilize the `dmidecode` command effectively.
