# Extracting Specific Hardware Details

In this step, we will explore how to use the `dmidecode` command to extract specific hardware details from the system.

First, let's extract the BIOS information:

```bash
sudo dmidecode -t bios
```

Example output:

```
# dmidecode 3.3
Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
SMBIOS 3.2.0 present.

Handle 0x0000, DMI type 0, 24 bytes

                BIOS boot specification is supported
                Targeted content distribution is supported
                UEFI is supported
```

This command displays detailed information about the system's BIOS, including the vendor, version, release date, and various BIOS characteristics.

Next, let's extract the information about the system's chassis:

```bash
sudo dmidecode -t chassis
```

Example output:

```
# dmidecode 3.3
Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
SMBIOS 3.2.0 present.

Handle 0x0003, DMI type 3, 21 bytes
Chassis Information
        Manufacturer: VMware, Inc.
        Type: Virtual Machine
        Lock: Not Present
        Version: None
        Serial Number: VMware-42 1d 93 c1 d1 2f 2a 19-5a 1c 4f 3b 6a 4f 9a 6d
        Asset Tag: Not Specified
        Boot-up State: Safe
        Power Supply State: Safe
        Thermal State: Safe
        Security Status: None
```

This command displays information about the system's chassis, including the manufacturer, type, serial number, and various chassis states.

Finally, let's extract the information about the system's slots:

```bash
sudo dmidecode -t slot
```

Example output:

```
# dmidecode 3.3
Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
SMBIOS 3.2.0 present.

Handle 0x0008, DMI type 9, 17 bytes
System Slot Information
        Designation: PCI Slot 1
        Type: 32-bit PCI
        Current Usage: Available
        Length: Long
        ID: 1
        Characteristics:
                3.3 V is provided
                PME signal is supported

Handle 0x0009, DMI type 9, 17 bytes
System Slot Information
        Designation: PCI Slot 2
        Type: 32-bit PCI
        Current Usage: Available
        Length: Long
        ID: 2
        Characteristics:
                3.3 V is provided
                PME signal is supported
```

This command displays information about the system's expansion slots, including the slot designation, type, current usage, and various slot characteristics.

The `dmidecode` command provides a wealth of detailed hardware information, and the specific information displayed will depend on the hardware configuration of the system.
