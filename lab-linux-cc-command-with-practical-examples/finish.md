# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `cc` command, which is a compiler driver for the C programming language. You explored the basic syntax of the `cc` command and the most common options, such as `-o` to specify the output file, `-c` to compile without linking, `-g` to include debugging information, and `-O<n>` to set the optimization level. You also learned how to compile a simple C program using the `cc` command, including how to compile multiple source files into a single executable.
