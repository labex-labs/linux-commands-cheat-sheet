# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `cc` command, a compiler driver for the C programming language. You will understand the purpose and syntax of the `cc` command, compile a simple C program, and explore various compiler flags and optimization options. The lab covers the following steps:

Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the cc Command: You will learn about the basic syntax of the `cc` command and the common options it supports, such as specifying the output file, compiling source files into object files, and enabling debugging or optimization.

Compile a Simple C Program Using the cc Command: You will create a simple C program and use the `cc` command to compile it into an executable.

Explore Compiler Flags and Optimization Options: You will learn about different compiler flags and optimization options that can be used with the `cc` command to control the compilation process and generate optimized code.
