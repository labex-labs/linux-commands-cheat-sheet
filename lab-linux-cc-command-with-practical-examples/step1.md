# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the cc Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `cc` command, which is a compiler driver for the C programming language. The `cc` command is used to compile C source code files into executable programs.

First, let's explore the basic syntax of the `cc` command:

```
cc [options] file(s)
```

The `cc` command takes one or more C source code files as input, along with various options to control the compilation process. The most common options include:

- `-o <output>`: Specifies the name of the output executable file.
- `-c`: Compiles the source file(s) into object file(s) without linking.
- `-g`: Includes debugging information in the compiled output.
- `-O<n>`: Specifies the optimization level, where `n` is a number from 0 to 3.

For example, to compile a simple C program named `hello.c` and create an executable named `hello`, you can use the following command:

```
cc -o hello hello.c
```

Example output:

```

```

This will compile the `hello.c` file and create an executable named `hello`.

Now, let's try compiling a more complex C program that includes multiple source files. Suppose you have two files, `main.c` and `utils.c`, and you want to create an executable named `myapp`. You can use the following command:

```
cc -o myapp main.c utils.c
```

Example output:

```

```

In this example, the `cc` command compiles both `main.c` and `utils.c` and links them together to create the final executable `myapp`.
