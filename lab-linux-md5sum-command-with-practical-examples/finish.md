# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `md5sum` command in Linux, which is used to generate and verify the MD5 checksum of a file. The MD5 checksum is a 128-bit hash value that can be used to uniquely identify a file and ensure its integrity. You generated MD5 checksums for files and learned how to use these checksums to verify the integrity of downloaded files. Finally, you explored how to verify file integrity using MD5 checksums, which is commonly used to ensure the correctness of downloaded software packages or disk images.
