# Understand the Purpose of the md5sum Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `md5sum` command in Linux. The `md5sum` command is used to generate and verify the MD5 checksum of a file. The MD5 checksum is a 128-bit hash value that can be used to uniquely identify a file and ensure its integrity.

The MD5 checksum is commonly used to verify the integrity of downloaded files, such as software packages or disk images. If the MD5 checksum of a downloaded file matches the expected checksum, it indicates that the file has been downloaded correctly and has not been corrupted during the transfer.

Let's start by running the `md5sum` command on a file:

```bash
cd ~/project
echo "This is a test file." > test.txt
md5sum test.txt
```

Example output:

```
e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e  test.txt
```

The output shows the MD5 checksum of the `test.txt` file, which is `e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e`. You can use this checksum to verify the integrity of the file later.
