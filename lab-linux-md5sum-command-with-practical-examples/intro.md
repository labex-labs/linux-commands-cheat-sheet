# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `md5sum` command to generate and verify the MD5 checksums of files. The `md5sum` command is a useful tool for ensuring the integrity of downloaded files, as it can be used to detect any changes or corruption that may have occurred during the download process. You will start by understanding the purpose of the `md5sum` command, then learn how to generate MD5 checksums for files, and finally, how to use those checksums to verify the integrity of the files.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the Purpose of the `md5sum` Command
2. Generate MD5 Checksums for Files
3. Verify File Integrity Using MD5 Checksums
