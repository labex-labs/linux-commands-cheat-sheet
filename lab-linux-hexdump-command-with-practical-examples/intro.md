# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `hexdump` command, a powerful tool for viewing and manipulating binary data. The `hexdump` command allows you to display the contents of a file or any other binary data in a human-readable hexadecimal format. We will start by introducing the basic usage of the `hexdump` command, and then dive deeper into customizing the output to suit your needs. This lab is designed to provide practical examples and help you gain a better understanding of working with binary data in the Linux environment.
