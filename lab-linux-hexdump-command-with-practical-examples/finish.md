# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `hexdump` command, a powerful tool for viewing and manipulating binary data. We learned how to use the basic `hexdump` command to display the contents of a file in a human-readable hexadecimal format, and how to customize the output using various options such as the `-C` (canonical) option. We also discovered how to use `hexdump` to view the contents of devices and other binary data sources. Finally, we practiced viewing and analyzing binary data in more detail by creating a binary file and using `hexdump` to inspect its contents.
