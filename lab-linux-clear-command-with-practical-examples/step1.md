# Understand the Purpose of the clear Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and usage of the `clear` command in Linux. The `clear` command is a simple yet useful utility that helps you to clear the contents of the terminal screen, making it easier to read and navigate.

The `clear` command works by sending the "clear screen" escape sequence to the terminal, which instructs the terminal to clear its display and move the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen. This can be particularly useful when your terminal becomes cluttered with output from previous commands, making it difficult to see the current prompt and input.

Let's try using the `clear` command:

```
$ clear
```

Example output:

```
[The terminal screen is now cleared]
```

As you can see, the terminal screen is now cleared, and you can see a clean prompt ready for your next command.

The `clear` command is often used in shell scripts or aliases to automatically clear the terminal screen before or after performing certain tasks, making the output more readable and organized.
