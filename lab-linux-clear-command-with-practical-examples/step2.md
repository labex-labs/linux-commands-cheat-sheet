# Clear the Terminal Screen with the clear Command

In this step, you will learn how to use the `clear` command to clear the contents of the terminal screen.

First, let's check the current contents of the terminal:

```
$ echo "This is some text in the terminal."
This is some text in the terminal.
```

Now, let's use the `clear` command to clear the screen:

```
$ clear
```

Example output:

```
[The terminal screen is now cleared]
```

As you can see, the terminal screen is now cleared, and you can see a clean prompt ready for your next command.

The `clear` command is often used to improve the readability and organization of the terminal output, especially when working with long-running commands or scripts that generate a lot of output.
