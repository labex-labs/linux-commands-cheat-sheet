# Analyze ELF File Headers and Sections Using readelf

In this step, you will learn how to use the `readelf` command to analyze the headers and sections of ELF files in more detail.

Let's start by examining the ELF file header of the `/bin/ls` binary:

```bash
readelf -h /bin/ls
```

Example output:

```
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x4047e0
  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          6472 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         9
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         28
  Section header string table index: 27
```

This output provides detailed information about the ELF file header, including the file class, data encoding, type, machine architecture, and various offsets and sizes.

Next, let's explore the sections of the ELF file:

```bash
readelf -S /bin/ls
```

Example output:

```
There are 28 section headers, starting at offset 0x1998:

Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type             Address           Offset
       Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  Align
  [ 0]                   NULL             0000000000000000  00000000
       0000000000000000  0000000000000000           0     0     0
  [ 1] .interp           PROGBITS         0000000000400238  00000238
       000000000000001c  0000000000000000   A       0     0     1
  [ 2] .note.gnu.build-i NOTE             0000000000400254  00000254
       0000000000000024  0000000000000000   A       0     0     4
  ...
```

This command displays the section headers, providing information about the various sections in the ELF file, such as their names, types, addresses, sizes, and other attributes.

You can further explore the sections by using the `readelf -e` command, which displays the full ELF file information, including the program headers, section headers, and symbol table:

```bash
readelf -e /bin/ls
```

This command will provide a comprehensive view of the ELF file, allowing you to understand its structure and contents in detail.
