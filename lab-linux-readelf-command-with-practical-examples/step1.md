# Understand the Purpose and Functionality of the readelf Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and functionality of the `readelf` command in Linux. The `readelf` command is a powerful tool used to analyze the contents of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, which are the standard binary format for executables, shared libraries, and object files on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

The `readelf` command provides detailed information about the ELF file, including its header, sections, segments, and symbols. This information can be useful for tasks such as debugging, reverse engineering, and understanding the structure of binary files.

Let's start by exploring the basic usage of the `readelf` command:

```bash
readelf -h /bin/ls
```

Example output:

```
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x4047e0
  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          6472 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         9
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         28
  Section header string table index: 27
```

The output shows the various fields of the ELF file header, providing information about the file's type, architecture, entry point, and other metadata. This information can be useful for understanding the structure and purpose of the binary file.

In the next step, you will explore the basic usage of the `readelf` command in more detail.
