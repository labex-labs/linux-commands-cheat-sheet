# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `readelf` command and its practical applications. The `readelf` command is a powerful tool used to analyze the contents of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, which are the standard binary format for executables, shared libraries, and object files on Linux and other Unix-like systems. Through this lab, you will explore the basic usage of `readelf`, understand its purpose and functionality, and learn how to analyze ELF file headers and sections using this command. The knowledge gained from this lab can be useful for tasks such as debugging, reverse engineering, and understanding the structure of binary files.
