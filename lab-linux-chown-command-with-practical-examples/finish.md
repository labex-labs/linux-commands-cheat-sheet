# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the fundamental concepts of file ownership and permissions in the Linux operating system. We learned that every file and directory has an owner and a group associated with it, and the file permissions determine the read, write, and execute access for the owner, group, and others. We also created a new file and examined its ownership and permissions.

Next, we learned how to change the file ownership using the `chown` command. This command allows us to modify the owner and/or group of a file or directory. We practiced using the `chown` command to change the ownership of a file. Finally, we explored the recursive option `-R` with `chown`, which enables us to change the ownership of a directory and all its contents simultaneously.
