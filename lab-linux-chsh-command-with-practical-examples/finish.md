# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `chsh` command, which is used to change the default shell for a user account in a Linux system. We first understood the purpose of the `chsh` command and how to use it to change the default shell. We then demonstrated how to change the default shell for the `labex` user from `/bin/bash` to `/bin/zsh`, and verified the change by checking the current shell being used. The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help users effectively manage the default shell for their user accounts.
