# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the gawk command, a powerful text processing tool in Linux. You started by exploring the basics of the gawk command, including how to check the version and use it to print the contents of a sample text file. You then learned how to extract specific data from the text file, such as printing the second column (Age) using the `$2` syntax. Finally, you discovered how to perform calculations and transformations on the data using gawk, such as calculating the average age.

Throughout the lab, you gained a solid understanding of the versatility of the gawk command and its ability to manipulate and extract data from text files. These skills can be applied to a wide range of text-based tasks, from data analysis to report generation and automation.
