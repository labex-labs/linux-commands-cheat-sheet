# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the purpose and usage of the `autoconf` command in Linux, which is a tool used to generate shell scripts that can automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to various Unix-like systems. We then configured and built a simple C program using `autoconf` by creating a `configure.ac` file and generating the `configure` script. Finally, we explored how to customize the `autoconf` configuration files for more complex projects.
