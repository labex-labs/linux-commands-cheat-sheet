# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `autoconf` command in Linux. `autoconf` is a tool used to generate shell scripts that can automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Unix-like systems. We will start by installing the `autoconf` package, then create a simple C program and use `autoconf` to generate the necessary configuration files. Finally, we will customize the `autoconf` configuration files for more complex projects.
