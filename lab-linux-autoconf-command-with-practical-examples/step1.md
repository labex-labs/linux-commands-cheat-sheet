# Understand the Purpose and Usage of autoconf Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `autoconf` command in Linux. `autoconf` is a tool used to generate shell scripts that can automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Unix-like systems.

First, let's install the `autoconf` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf
```

Example output:

```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  m4 perl
Suggested packages:
  autoconf-archive gnu-standards autoconf-doc
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  autoconf m4 perl

The `autoconf` command is used to generate configuration scripts (usually named `configure`) from template files (usually named `configure.ac` or `configure.in`). These configuration scripts are then used to configure the source code for compilation and installation on the target system.

Here's a simple example of how to use `autoconf`:

```bash
# Create a simple C program
cat > hello.c << EOF
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
EOF

# Create the configure.ac file
cat > configure.ac << EOF
AC_INIT([hello], [1.0], [your@email.com])
AC_PROG_CC
AC_OUTPUT([Makefile])
EOF

# Generate the configure script
autoconf
```

Now, let's run the generated `configure` script and build the program:

```bash
./configure
make
```

Example output:

```
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... no
checking for mawk... mawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
make  all-am
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/labex/project'
gcc -g -O2 -o hello hello.c
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/labex/project'
```

The `autoconf` command generates the `configure` script, which is then used to configure the source code for compilation and installation. The `configure` script detects the system's features and capabilities, and generates a Makefile that can be used to build the software.
