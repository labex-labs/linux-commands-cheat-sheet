# Create New Files Using the touch Command

In this step, we will learn how to create new files using the `touch` command in various ways.

First, let's create a single file:

```
cd ~/project
touch new_file.txt
```

Example output:

```

```

The `touch new_file.txt` command created a new file named `new_file.txt` in the `~/project` directory.

Next, let's create multiple files at once:

```
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

Example output:

```

```

The `touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt` command created three new files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt` in the `~/project` directory.

You can also use wildcards to create multiple files with a similar naming pattern:

```
touch *.md
```

Example output:

```

```

This `touch *.md` command created all the files with the `.md` extension in the `~/project` directory.
