# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose and syntax of the `touch` command in Linux, including common options such as `-a` to update access time, `-m` to update modification time, and `-d` or `-t` to set specific access and modification times. We also practiced creating new files using the `touch` command, both individually and in batches, as well as using wildcards to create multiple files with a similar naming pattern. Finally, we explored how to modify file timestamps with the `touch` command.
