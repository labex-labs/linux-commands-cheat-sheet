# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose of the `groupdel` command in Linux, which is used to delete a group from the system. We first created a test group called `testgroup` to demonstrate the usage of the `groupdel` command. Then, we created three additional test groups (`group1`, `group2`, and `group3`) to further explore the `groupdel` command. Finally, we used the `groupdel` command to delete the test groups that were created earlier.
