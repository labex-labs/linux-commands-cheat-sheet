# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) printing system, which is the standard printing system used in many Linux distributions. You explored the CUPS web interface, which provides a user-friendly way to manage printers and print jobs. You also learned how to use the `cupsd` command, the CUPS print daemon, to manage printers from the command line, including listing available printers and adding new ones.
