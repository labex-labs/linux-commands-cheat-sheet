# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the sliplogin command in Linux, which is used to establish a SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) connection. You understood the basic usage of the sliplogin command, including its options and the tty-device parameter. You then configured the sliplogin command by creating a configuration file, setting the necessary parameters such as the SLIP device, speed, local and remote addresses. Finally, you learned how to troubleshoot the sliplogin command by checking the log files and verifying the SLIP connection.
