# Explore Python Built-in Functions in Linux

In this step, we will explore some of the built-in functions in Python and how to use them in a Linux environment. Python provides a wide range of built-in functions that can be used to perform various tasks, such as string manipulation, file operations, and mathematical calculations.

Let's start by importing the `math` module, which provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

```python
import math
```

Now, let's explore some commonly used built-in functions:

1. **`print()`**: This function is used to display output to the console.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
# Example output:
# Hello, World!
```

2. **`len()`**: This function returns the length of an object, such as a string or a list.

```python
my_string = "Python is awesome!"
print(len(my_string))
# Example output:
# 18
```

3. **`type()`**: This function returns the data type of an object.

```python
my_number = 42
print(type(my_number))
# Example output:
# <class 'int'>
```

4. **`abs()`**: This function returns the absolute value of a number.

```python
my_number = -10
print(abs(my_number))
# Example output:
# 10
```

5. **`round()`**: This function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

```python
my_number = 3.14159
print(round(my_number, 2))
# Example output:
# 3.14
```

6. **`math.sqrt()`**: This function calculates the square root of a number.

```python
print(math.sqrt(16))
# Example output:
# 4.0
```

These are just a few examples of the built-in functions available in Python. As you progress, you'll learn about many more functions and how to use them effectively in your Python scripts.
