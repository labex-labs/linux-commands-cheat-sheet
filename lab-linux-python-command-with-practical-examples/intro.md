# Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the power of Python in a Linux environment. You will learn how to utilize built-in functions, manipulate strings, and automate file and directory management tasks. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage Python's capabilities to streamline your workflow and enhance your productivity.

The first step involves exploring Python's built-in functions, such as `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `abs()`, `round()`, and `math.sqrt()`. These functions provide a wide range of functionalities that can be applied to various programming tasks.

Next, you will delve into string manipulation commands, including `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, and `join()`. These commands allow you to efficiently manipulate and transform text data, which is a fundamental skill in many programming and scripting scenarios.

Finally, you will learn how to automate file and directory management tasks using Python. This includes creating, deleting, and renaming files and directories, as well as navigating the file system programmatically. These capabilities can significantly streamline your workflow and save you time.
