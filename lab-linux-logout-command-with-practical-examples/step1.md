# Understand the Purpose of the logout Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `logout` command in Linux. The `logout` command is used to terminate the current login session and return to the login prompt or the system's login screen.

The `logout` command is typically used when you want to log out of a terminal session, a remote SSH session, or a graphical desktop environment. When you execute the `logout` command, it will close the current session and return control to the login screen or the system's login prompt.

Let's try using the `logout` command:

```bash
logout
```

Example output:

```
logout
```

After executing the `logout` command, you should be returned to the login screen or prompt, depending on your system configuration.

The `logout` command is a useful tool for securely ending your current session and preventing unauthorized access to your account. It's important to use `logout` when you're done with your work to ensure the security of your system.
