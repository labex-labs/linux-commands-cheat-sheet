# Automate Logout Using Shell Scripts

In this step, we will explore how to automate the logout process using shell scripts.

Automating the logout process can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

- Logging out users after a certain period of inactivity
- Scheduling regular logout sessions for security or maintenance purposes
- Integrating the logout process into larger system automation workflows

Let's create a simple shell script to automate the logout process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to confirm logout
read -p "Are you sure you want to log out? (y/n) " confirm
if [ "$confirm" != "y" ]; then
  echo "Logout canceled."
  exit 0
fi

# Logout the current user
logout
```

Save this script as `auto_logout.sh` in the `~/project` directory.

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ~/project/auto_logout.sh
~/project/auto_logout.sh
```

Example output:

```
Are you sure you want to log out? (y/n) y
logout
```

The script first prompts the user to confirm the logout action. If the user enters "y", the script executes the `logout` command to log out the current user.

You can further customize this script to add more functionality, such as:

- Automatically logging out after a certain period of inactivity
- Integrating the script with system services or cron jobs for scheduled logout

Automating the logout process can help improve the security and management of your system by ensuring that user sessions are properly terminated when not in use.
