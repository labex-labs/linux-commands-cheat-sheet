# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the `logout` command in Linux, which is used to terminate the current login session and return to the login prompt or the system's login screen. We then learned how to log out from the current session by simply executing the `logout` command. Finally, we discussed how to automate the logout process using shell scripts, which can be useful for various scenarios such as automatically logging out users after a certain period of inactivity.
