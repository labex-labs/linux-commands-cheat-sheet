# Logout from the Current Session

In this step, we will learn how to log out from the current session using the `logout` command.

To log out from the current session, simply execute the `logout` command in the terminal:

```bash
logout
```

Example output:

```
logout
```

After executing the `logout` command, you should be returned to the login screen or prompt, depending on your system configuration.

It's important to note that the `logout` command is different from the `exit` command. The `exit` command is used to terminate the current shell or terminal session, while the `logout` command is specifically used to log out of the current user session.

Using the `logout` command ensures that your current session is properly terminated and that any resources or processes associated with your session are released. This helps maintain the security and integrity of your system.
