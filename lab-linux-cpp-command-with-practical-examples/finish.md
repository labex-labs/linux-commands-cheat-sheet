# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to compile and run C++ programs in a Linux environment using the `g++` compiler. You created a simple C++ program, compiled it, and executed the resulting executable. Additionally, you explored more advanced C++ development tasks, such as compiling multiple source files, using compiler flags, and managing C++ project structures. These skills are essential for developing and maintaining complex C++ applications in a Linux environment.
