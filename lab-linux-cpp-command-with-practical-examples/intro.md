# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to compile and run C++ programs in a Linux environment using the `g++` compiler. You will start by creating a simple C++ program, then use the `g++` compiler to build the executable, and finally run the program. Additionally, you will explore more advanced C++ development tasks, such as compiling multiple source files, using compiler flags, and managing C++ project structures. This lab covers essential skills for C++ development on the Linux platform.

The lab provides step-by-step guidance on utilizing the `g++` compiler for C++ development, including managing C++ code within the Linux file system. This hands-on experience will equip you with the necessary knowledge to effectively compile and run C++ programs in a Linux environment.
