# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `rmdir` command in Linux, which is used to remove empty directories. You explored the basic syntax and common options of the `rmdir` command, and practiced creating and deleting empty directories. Additionally, you learned that the `rmdir` command cannot remove non-empty directories, and in such cases, you need to either remove the files inside the directory first or use the `rm -r` command to recursively remove the directory and its contents.
