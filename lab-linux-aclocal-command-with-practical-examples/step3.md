# Integrating aclocal with Autoconf

In this final step, we will learn how to integrate the `aclocal.m4` file with the Autoconf build process.

First, let's run the `autoconf` command to generate the `configure` script:

```bash
autoconf
```

Example output:

```
configure.ac:1: installing './install-sh'
configure.ac:1: installing './missing'
```

As you can see, the `autoconf` command has generated the `configure` script, which is responsible for configuring the build environment for our software project.

Now, let's run the `configure` script to see how it interacts with the `aclocal.m4` file:

```bash
./configure
```

Example output:

```
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... no
checking for mawk... mawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
```

The `configure` script has used the macro definitions from the `aclocal.m4` file to configure the build environment for our software project.

Finally, let's take a look at the contents of the `configure` script:

```bash
cat configure
```

Example output:

```
#! /bin/sh
# Guess values for system-dependent variables and create Makefiles.
# Generated by GNU Autoconf 2.71.

# This script was automatically generated from config.status. Run this script,
# or rerun config.status, to recreate the current configuration.

# This file is freely redistributable without restrictions.

```

As you can see, the `configure` script contains the necessary logic to configure the build environment for our software project, based on the macro definitions in the `aclocal.m4` file.

In summary, the `aclocal` command is used to generate the `aclocal.m4` file, which is then integrated with the Autoconf build process through the `autoconf` command. This allows for a more robust and automated build process for our software project.
