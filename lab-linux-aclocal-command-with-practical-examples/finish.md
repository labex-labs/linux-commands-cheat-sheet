# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `aclocal` command, which is a part of the Autoconf build automation tool. We learned that the `aclocal` command is used to generate the `aclocal.m4` file, which contains macro definitions that are crucial for the Autoconf build process. The `aclocal.m4` file is used by the `autoconf` command to generate the `configure` script, which is responsible for configuring the build environment for a software project. We also examined the contents of the `aclocal.m4` file to understand the macro definitions it contains.

Next, we will learn how to integrate the `aclocal.m4` file with the Autoconf build process.
