# Generating aclocal.m4 File

In this step, we will learn how to generate the `aclocal.m4` file, which is a crucial component in the Autoconf build process.

The `aclocal.m4` file contains macro definitions that are used by the `autoconf` command to generate the `configure` script. This script is responsible for configuring the build environment for a software project.

Let's start by creating a simple `configure.ac` file, which is the input file for the `autoconf` command:

```bash
nano configure.ac
```

Add the following content to the `configure.ac` file:

```
AC_INIT([my-project], [1.0], [user@example.com])
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([main.c])
AC_OUTPUT
```

Now, let's run the `aclocal` command to generate the `aclocal.m4` file:

```bash
aclocal
```

Example output:

```
aclocal: creating ./aclocal.m4
```

As you can see, the `aclocal` command has created the `aclocal.m4` file in the current directory. This file contains the necessary macro definitions for the Autoconf build process.

Now, let's take a closer look at the contents of the `aclocal.m4` file:

```bash
cat aclocal.m4
```

Example output:

```

The `aclocal.m4` file contains the necessary macro definitions for the Autoconf build process. These macros are used by the `autoconf` command to generate the `configure` script.

In the next step, we will learn how to integrate the `aclocal.m4` file with the Autoconf build process.
