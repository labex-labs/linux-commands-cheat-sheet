# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `aclocal` command, which is a part of the Autoconf build automation tool. The `aclocal` command is used to generate the `aclocal.m4` file, a crucial component in the Autoconf build process. We will learn how to use `aclocal` to create the `aclocal.m4` file and integrate it with the Autoconf build process. This lab covers the introduction to the `aclocal` command, generating the `aclocal.m4` file, and integrating `aclocal` with Autoconf.
