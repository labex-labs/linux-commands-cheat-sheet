# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the `tac` command in Linux, which is used to reverse the order of lines in a text file. You explored the basic command structure and some common options like `-b`, `-r`, and `-s`. Then, you practiced using `tac` to reverse the order of lines in a sample text file, and learned how to save the reversed output to a new file.

Finally, you discovered how to combine the `tac` command with other Linux commands, such as `grep` and `sed`, to perform more advanced text processing operations. This allows you to leverage the power of `tac` in combination with other tools to manipulate and analyze text data in various ways.
