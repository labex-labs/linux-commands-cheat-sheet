# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `iconv` command, a powerful tool in Linux for converting text between different character encodings. You explored the basic syntax of the `iconv` command and how to check the available character encodings on your system. You then practiced performing encoding conversions, such as converting a UTF-8 text file to ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) and UTF-16 encodings, and observed the impact on the text content. Overall, the `iconv` command was demonstrated as a versatile tool for handling multilingual text and ensuring consistent character encoding across different systems and applications.
