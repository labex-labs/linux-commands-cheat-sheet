# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the gs Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and syntax of the `gs` (Ghostscript) command in Linux. Ghostscript is a powerful tool used for processing and manipulating PostScript and PDF files.

First, let's understand the purpose of the `gs` command. Ghostscript is a versatile tool that can be used for various tasks, such as:

- Converting PDF files to different image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF)
- Optimizing PDF files by reducing file size
- Rendering PostScript and PDF files for display or printing
- Extracting text and images from PDF files
- Applying various transformations and effects to PDF and PostScript files

Now, let's look at the basic syntax of the `gs` command:

```bash
gs [options] [input_file] [output_file]
```

Here's a breakdown of the different components:

- `gs`: The command to invoke Ghostscript.
- `[options]`: Various options that can be used to customize the behavior of Ghostscript. These options can be used to specify the input and output file types, resolution, compression, and more.
- `[input_file]`: The file (usually a PostScript or PDF file) that you want to process.
- `[output_file]`: The file where the processed output will be saved.

Example:

```bash
gs -sDEVICE=jpeg -o output.jpg input.pdf
```

This command will convert the `input.pdf` file to a JPEG image file named `output.jpg`.

Let's try this out in the next step!
