# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and syntax of the `gs` (Ghostscript) command in Linux, a powerful tool for processing and manipulating PostScript and PDF files. We learned that Ghostscript can be used for a variety of tasks, such as converting PDF files to different image formats, optimizing PDF files by reducing file size, and applying various transformations and effects to PDF and PostScript files. We also practiced using the `gs` command to convert a sample PDF file to a JPEG image, demonstrating its versatility in handling different file formats.
