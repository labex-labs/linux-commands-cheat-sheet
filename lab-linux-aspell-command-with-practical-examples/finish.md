# Summary

In this lab, we first installed the aspell package on the Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. Aspell is a spell-checking library and program that can be used to correct spelling errors in text files. We updated the package index and then installed the aspell package and its dependencies.

Next, we learned how to use aspell to correct spelling errors in a text file. We can run the aspell command with the appropriate options to check and correct the spelling in a given text file.
