# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and basic syntax of the `diff` command in Linux, which is used to compare the contents of two files and display the differences between them. You created sample text files and used the `diff` command to compare them, understanding the output format and common options such as `-c`, `-u`, `-r`, and `-w`. You also explored how to use the `diff` command to compare the contents of two text files with differences and interpret the output, which shows the lines that are different between the files.
