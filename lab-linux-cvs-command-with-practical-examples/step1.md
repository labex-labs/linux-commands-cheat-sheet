# Introduction to CVS (Concurrent Versions System)

In this step, we will explore the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), a popular version control system used for managing source code and project files.

First, let's install the CVS package on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cvs
```

Example output:

```

CVS is a version control system that allows multiple users to collaborate on a project by tracking changes to files and directories. It provides features like branching, merging, and conflict resolution, making it easier to manage code changes and maintain a history of the project.

Next, let's create a new CVS repository and check out a project.
