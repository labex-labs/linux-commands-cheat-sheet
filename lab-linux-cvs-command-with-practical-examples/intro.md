# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), a popular version control system used for managing source code and project files. We will start by installing the CVS package on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, then create a new CVS repository and check out a project. Finally, we will learn how to commit changes to the CVS repository.
