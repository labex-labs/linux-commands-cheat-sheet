# Summary

In this lab, we learned the basics of the g++ command, which is the GNU C++ compiler. We explored how to compile a simple C++ program using g++ and examined various compiler flags and optimization options. We covered compiling a "Hello, World!" program and a more complex C++ program, as well as understanding the purpose of different compiler flags such as `-c`, `-o`, `-g`, `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-std=c++11`, and the optimization levels `-O0` to `-O3`. These steps provided a solid foundation for working with the g++ command and compiling C++ programs in a Linux environment.
