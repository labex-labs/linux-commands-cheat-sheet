# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux g++ command and its practical applications. We will start by understanding the basics of the g++ command, which is the GNU C++ compiler used to compile C++ source code into executable programs. Then, we will compile a simple C++ program using g++ and explore various compiler flags and optimization options. This lab aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the g++ command and its usage in software development.
