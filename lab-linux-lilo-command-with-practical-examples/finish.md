# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the lilo (Linux Loader) command, which is a boot loader used to load the Linux operating system. We learned how to check the version of the lilo command and view the current lilo configuration file. We also covered some basic lilo commands, such as updating the boot sectors and running a test run.

Next, we learned how to configure the lilo boot loader by creating a backup of the existing configuration file and making changes to the `/etc/lilo.conf` file, such as updating the boot device and kernel parameters. We then discussed the importance of updating the boot sectors after making changes to the configuration file.
