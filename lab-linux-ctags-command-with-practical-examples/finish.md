# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the ctags command, a tool used to generate tags for source code files. You installed the ctags package and generated tags for a C/C++ project, which can be used to quickly navigate and search through the code. You also learned how to view the generated tags file and understand the information it contains, such as function definitions and variable declarations.

Additionally, you explored how to use the ctags command to generate tags for an entire C/C++ project, which can be particularly useful for large codebases. The generated tags file provides a way to easily locate and jump to the definitions of various symbols in the source code, making it easier to understand and work with the project.
