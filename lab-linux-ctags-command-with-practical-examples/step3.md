# Navigating Source Code with ctags

In this step, you will learn how to use the ctags command to navigate through your source code.

First, make sure you have generated the tags file for your C/C++ project, as shown in the previous step.

To navigate to the definition of a symbol (such as a function or variable), you can use the `vim` or `emacs` editor, which have built-in support for ctags.

Open the `main.c` file in the `vim` editor:

```bash
vim ~/project/myproject/main.c
```

Now, place the cursor on the `main` function and press the `Ctrl+]` key. This will take you to the definition of the `main` function in the `tags` file.

To go back to the previous location, press the `Ctrl+t` key.

You can also use the `ctags` command directly from the terminal to navigate to a symbol's definition. For example, to go to the definition of the `main` function, run:

```bash
ctags -L main
```

This will open the `main.c` file and position the cursor at the beginning of the `main` function.

Another useful feature of ctags is the ability to list all the symbols defined in a project. To do this, run:

```bash
ctags -L
```

This will display a list of all the symbols in the project, along with their file and line number.
