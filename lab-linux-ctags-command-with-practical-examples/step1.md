# Introduction to ctags

In this step, you will learn about the ctags command, which is a tool used to generate tags for source code files. Tags are used to quickly navigate and search through the code, making it easier to find and understand the structure of a codebase.

First, let's install the ctags package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y exuberant-ctags
```

To generate tags for a C/C++ project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
ctags -R .
```

This will recursively generate tags for all the source files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

You can now view the generated tags file by running:

```bash
cat tags
```

Example output:

```
!_TAG_FILE_FORMAT	2	/extended format; --format=1 will not append ;" to lines/
!_TAG_FILE_SORTED	1	/0=unsorted, 1=sorted, 2=foldcase/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR	Universal Ctags Team	//
!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME	Universal Ctags	/Derived from Exuberant Ctags/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL	https://ctags.io/	/official site/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION	0.0.0	/a3c87ab/
main	main.c	/^int main() {$/;"	f
```

The tags file contains information about the various functions, variables, and other symbols defined in your source code. You can use this file to quickly navigate to the definition of a symbol in your code.
