# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `ctags` command, a tool that generates tags for source code files. This allows you to quickly navigate and search through your code, making it easier to understand the structure of a codebase. You will start by installing the `ctags` package, then generate tags for a C/C++ project and explore how to use the generated tags file to navigate your source code. The lab covers the basics of the `ctags` command and provides practical examples of its usage.

The `ctags` command is a widely-used tool in the Linux ecosystem, and the skills learned in this lab can be applied to various programming languages and projects. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to leverage the `ctags` command to improve your productivity and efficiency when working with large codebases.
