# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create and manage symbolic links (symlinks) in Linux. Symlinks are a special type of file that act as a reference to another file or directory, allowing you to access the target file or directory through the symlink. You created a symlink to a file, and observed how changes to the target file are reflected in the symlink. Additionally, you learned that when the target file is deleted, the symlink remains but points to a non-existent file. The lab also covered the difference between symbolic and hard links, and provided practical use cases for symlinks.
