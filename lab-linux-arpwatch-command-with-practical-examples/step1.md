# Understand the Purpose and Functionality of arpwatch

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and functionality of the arpwatch command in Linux. arpwatch is a network monitoring tool that tracks changes in Ethernet/IP address pairings on a network.

arpwatch monitors network traffic and logs any changes in the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. This information can be useful for detecting network security issues, such as ARP spoofing attacks, and for monitoring network activity.

Let's start by understanding the basic usage of arpwatch:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y arpwatch
```

The above commands will install the arpwatch package on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.

Once installed, you can start the arpwatch service:

```bash
sudo arpwatch
```

This will start the arpwatch daemon and begin monitoring your network for any ARP table changes.

Example output:

```
arpwatch: listening on eth0
```

The arpwatch command has several options and configurations that allow you to customize its behavior, such as specifying the network interface to monitor, setting email notifications, and configuring log file locations.

To learn more about the available options, you can check the arpwatch man page:

```bash
man arpwatch
```

This will provide detailed information about the arpwatch command and its various options.
