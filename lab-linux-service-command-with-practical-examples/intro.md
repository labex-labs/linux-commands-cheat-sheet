# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `service` command, which is a utility used to manage system services. We will learn how to start, stop, restart, and check the status of various system services, such as web servers, databases, and network services. The lab will cover the basic syntax of the `service` command and provide practical examples of its usage. Additionally, we will discuss the underlying service management mechanism, which may vary depending on the Linux distribution.
