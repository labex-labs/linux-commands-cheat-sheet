# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `last` command in Linux, which is used to display information about the last users who have logged into the system, including their username, the terminal they used, the time they logged in, and the time they logged out. You also explored the different options and output formats of the `last` command, such as displaying the last n entries, including additional information like system shutdown and reboot entries, displaying the IP address of the user's login, and omitting the hostname field from the output.

The `last` command is a useful tool for system administrators and users to monitor user login and logout activities, as well as system events like reboots. By understanding and using the `last` command, you can gain valuable insights into the usage and history of your Linux system.
