# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `fgrep` command in Linux. The `fgrep` command is a variant of the `grep` command that searches for fixed strings in text files, rather than regular expressions. You explored common options for the `fgrep` command, such as ignoring case, inverting the search, counting matching lines, and displaying line numbers. Additionally, you practiced using `fgrep` to search for fixed strings in text files and combining it with other Linux commands for efficient text manipulation.
