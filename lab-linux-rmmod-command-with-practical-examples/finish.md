# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and usage of the `rmmod` command in the Linux operating system. We learned that kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel as needed, and the `rmmod` command is used to remove a kernel module from the running system. We also practiced using the `lsmod` command to list the currently loaded kernel modules, and then removing the `vboxsf` module using the `rmmod` command. This allows us to manage the functionality of the kernel by adding or removing modules as required.
