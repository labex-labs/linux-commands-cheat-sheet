# Explore Practical Scenarios for Using rmmod

In this final step, we will explore some practical scenarios where the `rmmod` command can be useful.

One common scenario is when you need to update a kernel module. For example, let's say you have installed a new graphics driver and want to replace the old one. You can use the `rmmod` command to remove the old driver module, and then install the new one.

First, let's list the currently loaded kernel modules:

```bash
sudo lsmod
```

Example output:

```
Module                  Size  Used by
nvidia_drm             106496  0
nvidia_modeset        1028096  0
nvidia              28540928  1 nvidia_modeset
drm_kms_helper        184320  1 nvidia_drm
drm                   516096  4 nvidia_drm,drm_kms_helper
```

In this example, we can see that the `nvidia` module is currently loaded. To remove it, we can use the `rmmod` command:

```bash
sudo rmmod nvidia
```

After running this command, we can verify that the module has been removed:

```bash
sudo lsmod
```

Example output:

```
Module                  Size  Used by
nvidia_drm             106496  0
nvidia_modeset        1028096  0
drm_kms_helper        184320  1 nvidia_drm
drm                   516096  4 nvidia_drm,drm_kms_helper
```

Now, you can proceed to install the new graphics driver module.

Another practical scenario for using `rmmod` is when you need to troubleshoot a system issue. If you suspect that a particular kernel module is causing problems, you can try removing it to see if the issue is resolved.

For example, if you are experiencing network connectivity issues, you can try removing the network driver module and then checking if the problem is resolved.

```bash
sudo rmmod e1000e
```

After removing the module, you can test the network connectivity and see if the issue has been resolved.

Remember, when removing a kernel module, you should always ensure that the module is not in use and that its removal will not cause any critical system components to stop functioning. If you are unsure, it's best to consult the documentation or seek assistance from experienced system administrators.
