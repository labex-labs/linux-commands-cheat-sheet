# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `seq` command, which is a versatile tool for generating numeric sequences. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `seq` command, and provides practical examples on how to customize the output, such as adjusting the step size, formatting, and padding. This knowledge can be useful in various scripting and automation tasks.

The lab starts by explaining the basic syntax of the `seq` command and demonstrating how to generate simple numeric sequences. It then explores more advanced features, allowing you to create sequences with specific starting and ending points, as well as control the step size and formatting of the output. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively use the `seq` command to meet your needs.
