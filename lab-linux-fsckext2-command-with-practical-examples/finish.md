# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `fsck.ext2` command, which is used to check and repair the ext2 file system in Linux. You started by exploring the command's version and available options, then proceeded to create a test ext2 file system and intentionally corrupt it. You then used the `fsck.ext2` command to check and repair the file system, demonstrating its ability to detect and fix issues. Finally, you performed a forced file system check to ensure the integrity of the file system, even if it appeared to be clean.

The lab provided a practical understanding of the `fsck.ext2` command and its use in maintaining the health of ext2 file systems in Linux.
