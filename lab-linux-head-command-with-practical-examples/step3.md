# Apply head Command in Real-World Scenarios

In this step, you will learn how to apply the `head` command in real-world scenarios to solve common text processing and editing tasks.

One common use case for the `head` command is to quickly view the top of log files. Let's try this with the system log file:

```bash
sudo head /var/log/syslog
```

Example output:

```
Feb 24 12:34:56 myhost systemd[1]: Starting System Logging Service...
Feb 24 12:34:56 myhost systemd[1]: Started System Logging Service.
Feb 24 12:34:56 myhost rsyslogd[123]: [origin software="rsyslogd" swVersion="8.2001.0" x-pid="123" x-info="https://www.rsyslog.com"] start
Feb 24 12:34:56 myhost rsyslogd[123]: rsyslogd's groupid changed to 108
Feb 24 12:34:56 myhost rsyslogd[123]: rsyslogd's userid changed to 104
```

Another common use case is to extract the top lines from the output of a command. For example, let's say you want to see the top 3 processes by CPU usage:

```bash
top -bn1 | head -n 5
```

Example output:

```
top - 12:34:56 up 1 day, 12:34,  0 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.05, 0.01
Tasks:  85 total,   1 running,  84 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  0.3 us,  0.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.5 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
MiB Mem :   1969.3 total,    287.1 free,    654.9 used,   1027.3 buff/cache
MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.   1019.0 avail Mem

  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
    1 root      20   0    8572   5748   3900 S   0.0   0.3   0:01.22 systemd
```

By using the `head` command, you can quickly extract the top 5 lines of the `top` command output, which includes the system summary and the top processes.

These are just a few examples of how you can apply the `head` command in real-world scenarios. As you continue to work with text processing and editing tasks, you'll find many more opportunities to use this powerful command.
