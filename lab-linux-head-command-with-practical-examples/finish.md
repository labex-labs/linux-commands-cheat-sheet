# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the Linux `head` command, which is used to display the first few lines of a file. You explored the basic usage of the `head` command, including how to specify the number of lines to display. Additionally, you learned about various options available with the `head` command, such as displaying a specific number of bytes, suppressing the filename header when multiple files are specified, and displaying the filename header even when there is only one file.

You also explored how to apply the `head` command in real-world scenarios, where it can be a useful tool for quickly checking the contents of a file or viewing the top of a log file to see the most recent entries.
