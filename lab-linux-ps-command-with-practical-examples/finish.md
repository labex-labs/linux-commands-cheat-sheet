# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `ps` (process status) command, which is a fundamental Linux command used to display information about running processes on the system. You started with the basic `ps` command and explored options to display more detailed information, such as the `-e` and `-f` options. You also learned how to filter the process list by the user who owns the processes, using the `-u` or `--user` option. Additionally, you covered how to monitor the CPU and memory usage of running processes.

The lab provided a comprehensive understanding of the `ps` command and its practical applications in managing and monitoring running processes on a Linux system.
