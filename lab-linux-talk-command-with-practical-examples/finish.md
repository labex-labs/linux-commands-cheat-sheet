# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `talk` command, which is a tool for real-time text-based communication between two users on a Linux system. You explored the usage of the `talk` command, including how to initiate a conversation with another user and how to send messages during the talk session. You also learned about managing incoming talk requests, which allows you to accept or reject requests from other users.

The key learning points covered in this lab include understanding the basic syntax and usage of the `talk` command, initiating a talk session with a specific user, sending messages back and forth during the session, and handling incoming talk requests. These skills can be useful for real-time collaboration and communication between users on a Linux system.
