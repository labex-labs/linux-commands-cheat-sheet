# Send Messages Using the talk Command

In this step, we will learn how to send messages using the `talk` command.

First, let's start a talk session with another user. Assuming the other user's username is `labex2`, we can initiate the session like this:

```
$ talk labex2
```

This will send a request to the `labex2` user, and if they accept the request, the talk session will begin.

Once the session is established, you can start typing your message. Each line you type will be sent to the other user's terminal in real-time. The other user can also respond, and you will see their messages appear on your screen.

Example interaction:

```
Hello, how are you today?
I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?
I'm doing great! I just wanted to chat and catch up.
That's wonderful to hear! I'm always happy to chat.
```

To exit the talk session, simply type `quit` and press Enter.
