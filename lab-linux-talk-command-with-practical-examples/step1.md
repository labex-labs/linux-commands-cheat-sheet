# Understand the talk Command

In this step, we will explore the `talk` command, which is a tool used for real-time text-based communication between two users on a Linux system.

The `talk` command allows you to initiate a conversation with another user on the same system or a remote system, provided that the other user is also running the `talk` command and has accepted your request.

Let's start by checking the `talk` command's usage:

```
$ man talk
```

Example output:

```
TALK(1)                     User Commands                    TALK(1)

NAME
       talk - talk to another user

SYNOPSIS
       talk nickname [terminal]

DESCRIPTION
       The  talk  utility  is a visual communication program which copies lines from your terminal to that of another user.
```

The `talk` command takes two arguments:

1. `nickname`: The username of the user you want to talk to.
2. `terminal`: The terminal device of the other user (optional).

To initiate a talk session, you need to know the username of the person you want to talk to. If the other user is online and also running the `talk` command, you can start the conversation.

Let's try an example:

```
$ talk labex
```

This will initiate a talk session with the user `labex`. If the other user accepts the request, you will be able to see their responses in real-time, and they will be able to see your messages as well.

To exit the talk session, simply type `quit` and press Enter.
