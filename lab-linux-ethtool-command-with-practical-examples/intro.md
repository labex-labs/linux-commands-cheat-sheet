# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux ethtool command and its practical applications. The ethtool command is a powerful tool for retrieving and modifying network interface settings, allowing users to diagnose and troubleshoot network issues. We will start by understanding the various options provided by the ethtool command, then proceed to retrieve detailed information about the network interfaces on our system. Finally, we will demonstrate how to modify the settings of a network interface using the ethtool command.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the ethtool Command
2. Retrieve Network Interface Information
3. Modify Network Interface Settings

The ethtool command is a widely used tool in the Linux ecosystem, and it is typically pre-installed on most Linux distributions. However, if it is not available on your system, you may need to install the necessary package using your distribution's package manager.
