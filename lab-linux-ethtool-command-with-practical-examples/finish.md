# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the ethtool command, a powerful tool in Linux for retrieving and modifying network interface settings. We learned about the various options available in ethtool, such as displaying the supported features, link state, Energy-Efficient Ethernet status, pause parameters, ring buffer parameters, private flags, and offload parameters. We also discovered how to get a complete list of available options using the --help flag.

Next, we used the ethtool command to retrieve detailed information about the network interfaces on our system. We started by listing all the available network interfaces using the ip link show command, and then used ethtool to gather more specific details about the eth0 interface.
