# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and functionality of the `ltrace` command in Linux. `ltrace` is a powerful tool that allows you to trace system calls and library calls made by a process, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis. You then learned how to use `ltrace` to trace system calls and library calls made by a program, and how to analyze the output to identify potential issues or areas for optimization.
