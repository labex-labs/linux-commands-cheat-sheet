# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Linux `suspend` command, which allows you to suspend the system to RAM (S3) or disk (S4, also known as Hibernate). We explored the different power states available in Linux and how to use the `systemctl suspend` and `systemctl hibernate` commands to suspend the system to RAM and disk, respectively. We also learned how to resume the system from a suspended state by simply pressing the power button or any other key on the keyboard.
