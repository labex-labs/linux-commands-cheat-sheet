# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `suspend` command to suspend and resume your system, as well as manage different power states. You will explore the Suspend to RAM (S3) and Suspend to Disk (S4) states, and understand how to use the `systemctl suspend` and `systemctl hibernate` commands to put the system into these low-power states. By the end of this lab, you will be able to effectively manage your system's power consumption and quickly resume your work from a suspended state.
