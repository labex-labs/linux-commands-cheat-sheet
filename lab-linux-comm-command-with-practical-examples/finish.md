# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `comm` command in Linux, which is used to compare and contrast two sorted files, line by line. You explored how to use the `comm` command to identify lines that are unique to each file, as well as lines that are common to both files. Additionally, you learned how to customize the output of the `comm` command using various options, such as suppressing specific columns of output.

You also practiced using the `comm` command to compare and contrast two sample text files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, and observed the different output formats based on the options used.
