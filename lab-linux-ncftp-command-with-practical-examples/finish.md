# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the ncftp command-line FTP client on Ubuntu 22.04, connect to an FTP server using ncftp, and manage files and directories on the FTP server. We started by updating the package index and then installed the ncftp package. Next, we connected to an FTP server using the ncftp command and explored various commands to navigate the FTP server, upload and download files, and manage directories.
