# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the usage of the ncftp command-line FTP client on the Ubuntu 22.04 operating system. The lab covers the installation of ncftp, connecting to an FTP server, and managing files and directories on the server. We will start by installing the ncftp package, then demonstrate how to connect to an FTP server and perform various file management tasks, such as navigating directories and transferring files.
