# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the `bunzip2` command in Linux, which is used to decompress files compressed using the bzip2 algorithm. You explored the basic command syntax, as well as common options like `-k` to keep the compressed file and `-f` to force decompression. Then, you practiced extracting a compressed file using the `bunzip2` command, creating a decompressed file from a sample compressed file. Finally, you learned how to decompress multiple files at once using the `bunzip2` command.

The lab provided a comprehensive overview of the `bunzip2` command, covering its usage, options, and practical examples, equipping you with the knowledge to effectively decompress bzip2-compressed files in a Linux environment.
