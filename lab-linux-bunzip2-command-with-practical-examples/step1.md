# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the bunzip2 Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `bunzip2` command in Linux. The `bunzip2` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the bzip2 compression algorithm.

The basic syntax of the `bunzip2` command is as follows:

```
bunzip2 [options] file.bz2
```

Here, `file.bz2` is the name of the compressed file that you want to decompress.

Some common options for the `bunzip2` command include:

- `-k`: Keep the compressed file after decompression.
- `-f`: Force decompression, overwriting existing files without prompting.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which displays information about the decompression process.

To decompress a file using the `bunzip2` command, simply run the following command:

```
bunzip2 file.bz2
```

This will create a new file named `file` that contains the decompressed data.

Example output:

```
$ bunzip2 example.txt.bz2
$ ls
example.txt
```

In this example, the `example.txt.bz2` file is decompressed, and the resulting `example.txt` file is created.
