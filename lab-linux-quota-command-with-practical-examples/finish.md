# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the concept of disk quota in Linux, which allows system administrators to set limits on the amount of disk space that a user or group can consume on a file system. We learned about the key concepts of disk quota, including soft limits, hard limits, and inodes. We then proceeded to set disk quota for a user, monitoring and managing their disk quota usage. This hands-on approach provided a practical understanding of how to effectively implement and manage disk quota in a Linux environment.
