# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `uname` command, which is used to retrieve information about the operating system and hardware of the Linux system. You explored the basic usage of the `uname` command and the various options it provides to display different types of system information, such as the kernel name, operating system, processor type, and more. You also learned how to combine these options to get a more comprehensive output using the `-a` (or `--all`) option.

Furthermore, you discovered how to use the `uname` command to retrieve detailed information about your Linux system's hardware and software configurations, including the kernel name, network node hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, processor type, hardware platform, and operating system.
