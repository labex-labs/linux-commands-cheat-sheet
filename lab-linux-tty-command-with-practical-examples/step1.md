# Understand the tty Command

In this step, you will learn about the `tty` command, which is used to identify the current terminal device. The `tty` command is a useful tool for system administrators and developers who need to interact with the terminal or automate terminal-based tasks.

First, let's run the `tty` command to see the current terminal device:

```bash
tty
```

Example output:

```
/dev/pts/0
```

The output shows that the current terminal device is `/dev/pts/0`. This is a pseudo-terminal device, which is a virtual terminal created by the system to handle interactive user sessions.

The `tty` command can also be used to check if the current session is running in a terminal or not. If the output is `not a tty`, it means the current session is not running in a terminal, but rather in a non-interactive environment, such as a script or a background process.

```bash
tty
```

Example output:

```
not a tty
```

In this case, the `tty` command indicates that the current session is not running in a terminal.

The `tty` command can be useful in shell scripts to check the current terminal device or to determine if the script is running in an interactive session or a non-interactive environment.
