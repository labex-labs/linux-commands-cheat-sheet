# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `tty` command, which is used to identify the current terminal device. You discovered that the `tty` command can be used to check if the current session is running in a terminal or not, and how to use it to get information about the current terminal session, such as the terminal device and the terminal type.

Additionally, you learned how to use the `who` command to get more information about the current terminal session, including the username and the terminal device.
