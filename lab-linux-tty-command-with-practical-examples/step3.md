# Manage Terminal Sessions with the tty Command

In this step, you will learn how to manage terminal sessions using the `tty` command.

The `tty` command can be used to switch between different terminal sessions. For example, you can use the `tty` command to create a new terminal session and then switch back to the original session.

First, let's create a new terminal session using the `script` command:

```bash
script /tmp/terminal-session.log
```

This will start a new terminal session and record all the commands and output to the `/tmp/terminal-session.log` file.

You can now run various commands in this new terminal session. When you're done, you can exit the session by typing `exit`:

```
exit
```

This will return you to the original terminal session.

You can now view the log file that was created during the terminal session:

```bash
cat /tmp/terminal-session.log
```

The `tty` command can also be used to get the name of the current terminal device, which can be useful when writing shell scripts that need to interact with the terminal.

```bash
tty
```

Example output:

```
/dev/pts/0
```

This shows that the current terminal device is `/dev/pts/0`.

Understanding how to manage terminal sessions using the `tty` command can be useful when automating tasks or troubleshooting terminal-related issues.
