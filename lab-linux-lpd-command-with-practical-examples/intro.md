# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the lpd (Line Printer Daemon) command, a key tool for managing print jobs in Linux. We will learn how to configure the lpd daemon, manage print jobs, and perform various printing-related tasks. The lab covers the introduction to the lpd command, configuring the lpd daemon, and managing print jobs with lpd. The steps provided include checking the status of the lpd service, creating and enabling new print queues, and using commands like lpstat and lprm to manage the printing process.
