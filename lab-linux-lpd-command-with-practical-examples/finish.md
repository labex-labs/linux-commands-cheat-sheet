# Summary

In this lab, we explored the lpd (Line Printer Daemon) command, a key tool for managing print jobs in Linux. We learned how to check the status of the lpd service, list available print queues, view the status of the print queue, and cancel a specific print job. We then configured the lpd daemon by creating a new print queue and associating it with the CUPS-PDF virtual printer driver, and enabled the new print queue. These steps provide a solid foundation for managing printing processes on a Linux system.
