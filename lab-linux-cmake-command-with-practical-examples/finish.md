# Summary

In this lab, we first installed CMake, a popular build automation tool, on our Ubuntu 22.04 environment. We updated the package index and then installed the necessary packages for CMake. Next, we created a simple C++ project and learned how to use CMake to build and manage the project. We also explored different CMake build configurations, which allow us to customize the build process for different environments or purposes.
