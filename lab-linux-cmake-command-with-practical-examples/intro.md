# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `cmake` command and its practical applications. We will start by installing CMake, a popular build automation tool, on our Ubuntu 22.04 environment. Then, we will create a simple C++ project and learn how to use CMake to manage the build process. Finally, we will understand the different build configurations available in CMake.

The steps covered in this lab are essential for developers who work with C/C++ projects and need to manage complex build processes efficiently. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use CMake to streamline your development workflow.
