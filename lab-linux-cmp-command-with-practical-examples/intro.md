# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `cmp` command in Linux to compare the contents of two files, both text and binary. The `cmp` command compares two files byte-by-byte and reports the first location where the files differ. You will create sample text and binary files, then use the `cmp` command to compare them and explore its various options to customize the comparison.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `cmp` command and its basic usage.
2. Compare the contents of two text files using the `cmp` command.
3. Compare the contents of two binary files using the `cmp` command.
