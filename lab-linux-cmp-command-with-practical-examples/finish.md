# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `cmp` command in Linux, which is used to compare the contents of two files. You started by understanding the basic usage of the `cmp` command, where it compares two files byte-by-byte and reports the first location where the files differ. You then practiced comparing both text files and binary files using the `cmp` command, and explored various options to customize the comparison, such as displaying the byte number and differing bytes, and ignoring differences in case when comparing text files.
