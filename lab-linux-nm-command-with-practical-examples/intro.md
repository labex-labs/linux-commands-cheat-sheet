# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `nm` command, which is used to display the symbol information for object files. The `nm` command is a useful tool for developers and system administrators to understand the internal structure of executable files. We will learn how to use the `nm` command to display symbol information, filter the output, and gain insights into the structure of an executable program.

The lab covers the following steps: Introduction to the `nm` Command, Displaying Symbol Information of an Executable, and Filtering Symbol Information Using `nm` Options. These steps will provide a comprehensive understanding of the `nm` command and its practical applications in software development and system administration tasks.
