# Analyze Memory Usage with the free Command

In this step, you will learn how to analyze the memory usage on your system using the `free` command.

First, let's run the `free` command again to see the current memory usage:

```bash
free
```

Example output:

```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:        2048236     1023936      368584       72156      655716     1546700
Swap:       1048572           0     1048572
```

The output provides several important metrics:

- **total**: The total amount of physical memory (RAM) or swap space available on the system.
- **used**: The amount of memory or swap space currently in use.
- **free**: The amount of memory or swap space that is currently unused and available.
- **shared**: The amount of memory used by processes that can be shared with other processes.
- **buff/cache**: The amount of memory used for file buffers and cache.
- **available**: The amount of memory that is available for starting new applications, without swapping.

To better understand the memory usage, let's break down the output:

- The "Mem:" section shows the physical memory (RAM) usage. In this example, the system has 2GB of RAM, with 1GB used and 368MB free.
- The "Swap:" section shows the swap space usage. In this example, the system has 1GB of swap space, and none of it is currently in use.

You can also use the `-h` option to display the memory sizes in a more human-readable format:

```bash
free -h
```

Example output:

```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           2.0G        1.0G        360M         70M        640M        1.5G
Swap:          1.0G          0B        1.0G
```

This makes it easier to understand the memory usage at a glance.

By analyzing the output of the `free` command, you can get a good understanding of how your system is using its available memory resources. This information can be useful for troubleshooting performance issues or optimizing your system's memory usage.
