# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the free command in Linux. The free command is a useful tool for monitoring the system's memory usage, including both physical memory (RAM) and swap space. You explored how to use the free command with various options, such as -h to display the memory size in human-readable format, -m for megabytes, and -g for gigabytes. You also learned how to analyze the memory usage in more detail using the free command, understanding the different metrics it provides, such as total, used, free, shared, buff/cache, and available memory.
