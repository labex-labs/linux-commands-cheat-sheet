# Customizing Flatpak Environments

In this final step, we will explore how to customize Flatpak environments to suit your specific needs.

Flatpak provides a way to create custom runtime environments for your applications. Runtimes are the underlying libraries and dependencies that an application requires to run. By using custom runtimes, you can ensure that your applications have access to the specific versions of libraries and dependencies they need, without conflicts with other applications.

Let's create a custom runtime for the GIMP application:

```bash
# Create a new Flatpak runtime
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Platform//43

# Create a custom GIMP runtime based on the GNOME platform
flatpak build-init gimp-runtime org.gimp.GIMP org.gnome.Platform//43
flatpak build gimp-runtime flatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP
flatpak build-finish gimp-runtime
flatpak build-export ~/project/gimp-runtime gimp-runtime
```

Now, we can install the GIMP application using our custom runtime:

```bash
flatpak install ~/project/gimp-runtime org.gimp.GIMP
flatpak run org.gimp.GIMP
```

This will launch the GIMP application using the custom runtime we created, ensuring that it has access to the specific libraries and dependencies it requires.

You can further customize the runtime by modifying the dependencies, environment variables, or other settings within the `gimp-runtime` directory.
