# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the Flatpak package management tool, which provides a modern and secure way to install and manage applications on Linux. We installed the Flatpak package and enabled the Flathub repository to access a wider range of applications. Next, we learned how to search for and install Flatpak applications from the Flathub repository. Finally, we discussed how to customize Flatpak environments by creating and managing Flatpak remotes and applications.
