# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Flatpak package management tool for Linux. Flatpak is a modern and secure way to install and manage applications on your system, providing a consistent and isolated environment for each application. We will start by installing Flatpak and enabling the Flathub repository to access a wider range of applications. Then, we will learn how to search, install, and manage Flatpak applications on our Ubuntu 22.04 system. Finally, we will explore customizing Flatpak environments to suit our specific needs.
