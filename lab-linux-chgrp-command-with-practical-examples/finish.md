# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `chgrp` command in Linux, which is used to change the group ownership of files and directories. We started by understanding the syntax and common options of the `chgrp` command, and then practiced changing the group ownership of a single file and multiple files/directories. We also learned how to verify the group ownership of files using the `ls -l` command. The key takeaways from this lab are the usage of the `chgrp` command and the ability to change the group ownership of files and directories in a Linux environment.
