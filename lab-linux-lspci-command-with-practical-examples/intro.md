# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `lspci` command, which is a powerful tool used to display information about the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) buses and devices connected to the system. The lab will cover the purpose of the `lspci` command, its various options and flags, and how to identify the PCI devices on the system. This information can be useful for troubleshooting hardware issues, identifying the components of the system, and understanding the overall hardware configuration.

The lab will start by running the basic `lspci` command to display the PCI devices detected on the system, including their device names, vendor information, and other relevant details. We will then explore the different options and flags available with the `lspci` command to obtain more specific information about the PCI devices.
