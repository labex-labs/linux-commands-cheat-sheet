# Understand the Purpose of lspci Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `lspci` command in Linux. The `lspci` command is a powerful tool used to display information about the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) buses and devices connected to the system.

The `lspci` command provides detailed information about the PCI devices installed on your system, including their device names, vendor information, and other relevant details. This information can be useful for troubleshooting hardware issues, identifying the components of your system, and understanding the overall hardware configuration.

Let's start by running the basic `lspci` command:

```bash
sudo lspci
```

Example output:

```
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 8th Gen Core Processor Host Bridge/DRAM Registers (rev 07)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (rev 07)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 630 (rev 02)
00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH USB 3.1 xHCI Host Controller (rev 10)
00:14.2 RAM memory: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH Shared SRAM (rev 10)
00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH HECI Controller (rev 10)
00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH SATA AHCI Controller (rev 10)
00:1b.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH PCI Express Root Port #21 (rev f0)
00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev f0)
00:1d.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH PCI Express Root Port #13 (rev f0)
```

This output shows the various PCI devices detected on the system, including the host bridge, PCI bridges, VGA controller, USB controller, and more. Each line represents a PCI device, with information about its device ID, vendor, and other details.

The `lspci` command can also be used with various options and flags to display more specific information about the PCI devices. We will explore these in the next step.
