# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the `apropos` command in Linux. The `apropos` command allows us to search the system's manual pages (man pages) for relevant commands and information, particularly when we don't know the exact name of a command. We performed basic searches using `apropos` to find commands related to file search and directory listing, and learned how to customize our searches with regular expressions.

The `apropos` command is a valuable tool for exploring the available system commands and finding the right tool for the job. It provides a starting point to learn more about the relevant commands and their functionalities.
