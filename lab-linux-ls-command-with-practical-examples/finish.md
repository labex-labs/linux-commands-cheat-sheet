# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basic usage of the `ls` command in Linux, which is used to list the contents of a directory. You explored various options such as `-l` to display detailed file information, and `-a` to show hidden files. You also learned how to combine multiple options to get more comprehensive file listings. The lab then covered more advanced `ls` command options to retrieve detailed file information, including file permissions, ownership, and timestamps. Finally, you learned how to navigate directory structures using the `ls` command.
