# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `uptime` command, which provides information about the system's uptime and load average. The `uptime` command displays the current time, how long the system has been running, the number of users currently logged in, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. We will also examine the various options available with the `uptime` command to customize the output and extract specific information.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `uptime` Command
2. Explore `uptime` Command Options
3. Analyze System Uptime and Load Average
