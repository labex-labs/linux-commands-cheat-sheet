# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `ss` command in Linux to explore network connections, analyze socket statistics, and understand the state of network sockets. The `ss` command is a powerful tool that provides detailed information about TCP, UDP, and Unix domain sockets, allowing you to troubleshoot network-related issues and monitor the activity of your system.

You will start by understanding the purpose and syntax of the `ss` command, including the various options available to filter and display specific types of sockets. Then, you will explore network connections using the `ss` command, learning how to identify active connections, their local and remote addresses, and the processes associated with them. Finally, you will dive deeper into analyzing socket statistics and states, gaining insights into the performance and behavior of your network connections.
