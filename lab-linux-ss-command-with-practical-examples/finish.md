# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the `ss` command in Linux. The `ss` command is a powerful tool used to display information about network sockets, including TCP, UDP, and Unix domain sockets. You explored the common options for the `ss` command, such as `-t` for TCP sockets, `-u` for UDP sockets, and `-x` for Unix domain sockets. You also learned how to use the `ss` command to display detailed information about network connections, including the state of the connection, the number of bytes received and sent, and the local and remote addresses and ports.

Next, you learned how to use the `ss` command to analyze socket statistics and states. The `ss` command provides a wealth of information about the current state of network connections, which can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring network issues.
