# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `unalias` command in Linux to temporarily disable aliases that you have previously created. You will also learn how to create and manage aliases in the terminal, which can make your workflow more efficient by allowing you to use shorter commands instead of the full commands. The lab covers the purpose of the `unalias` command, how to create and manage aliases, and how to temporarily disable aliases using the `unalias` command. The content is presented in a clear and concise manner, without any additional information or sub-headings.
