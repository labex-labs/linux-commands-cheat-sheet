# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the unalias command in Linux, which is used to temporarily disable an alias that has been previously created. You also learned how to create and manage aliases in the terminal, which can save you time and make your workflow more efficient. The lab covered creating aliases for frequently used commands, such as `ls` and `git status`, and using the `unalias` command to temporarily disable an alias and use the original command instead.
