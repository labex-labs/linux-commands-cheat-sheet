In this lab, we will explore the Linux `restore` command and learn how to use it to recover files and directories from backup archives. The lab covers the purpose and usage of the `restore` command, as well as step-by-step examples on restoring a specific file and restoring an entire directory structure from a backup archive.

The `restore` command is a powerful tool in the Linux ecosystem, allowing users to recover data in case of data loss or system failures. It is typically used in conjunction with backup utilities like the `dump` command to extract and restore files or directories from backup archives.
