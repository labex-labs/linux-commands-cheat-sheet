# Summary

In this lab, you learned the purpose and usage of the restore command in Linux, which is used to recover files or entire directory structures from backup archives. You explored the basic syntax and common options of the restore command, such as the -i interactive mode, -r to restore the entire file system, -t to list the contents of the backup archive, and -x to extract a specific file or directory. You then practiced restoring a specific file from a backup archive created using the dump command, demonstrating the restore command's ability to selectively recover data.
