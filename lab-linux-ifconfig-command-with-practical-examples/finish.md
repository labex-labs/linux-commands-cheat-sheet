# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the `ifconfig` command in Linux. The `ifconfig` command is a powerful tool used to configure and manage network interfaces on a Linux system. We explored its primary purposes, which include displaying network interface information, configuring network interfaces, and troubleshooting network issues. We also learned about the basic syntax and available options of the `ifconfig` command, which allow us to effectively manage our network interfaces.
