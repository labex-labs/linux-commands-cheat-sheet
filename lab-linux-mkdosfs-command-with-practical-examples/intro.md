# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mkdosfs` command, which is used to create a DOS filesystem on a partition or format a USB drive. The `mkdosfs` command is part of the `dosfstools` package, which provides utilities for creating and checking MS-DOS FAT filesystems. We will learn how to create a DOS filesystem on a partition, as well as how to format a USB drive with a DOS filesystem. This lab covers practical examples and the common options available for the `mkdosfs` command.
