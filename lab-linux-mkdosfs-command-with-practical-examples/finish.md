# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `mkdosfs` command, which is used to create a DOS filesystem on a partition or format a USB drive. We first checked if the `dosfstools` package was installed on our system and then explored the basic syntax and common options of the `mkdosfs` command. We then demonstrated how to create a FAT32 filesystem on a partition using the `mkdosfs` command. Finally, we learned how to format a USB drive with a DOS filesystem.
