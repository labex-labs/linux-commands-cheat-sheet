# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the `dosfsck` command in Linux, which is used to check and repair errors on a FAT32 file system. You explored the various command options, such as automatically repairing the file system, verbose output, and testing the file system without making changes. You then demonstrated how to use the `dosfsck` command to check and repair errors on a FAT32 file system, including intentionally corrupting the file system and then using the `dosfsck` command to automatically repair it.
