# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `dump` command, a powerful tool for creating full system backups. We learned about the key features of the `dump` command, including its ability to perform full system backups, incremental backups, and compressed backups. We also discovered how the `dump` command can be integrated into backup scripts and schedules for automated and scheduled backups. Finally, we practiced performing a full system backup using the `dump` command, creating a backup file in a designated directory.
