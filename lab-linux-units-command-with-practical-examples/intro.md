# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `units` command, a versatile tool for converting between different units of measurement. The `units` command allows you to perform unit conversions and arithmetic operations involving various units, such as length, mass, time, and more, making it particularly useful for scientific, engineering, and everyday calculations.

We will start by understanding the basic usage of the `units` command, including how to convert between different units and perform arithmetic operations with units. Then, we will focus on converting between different time units, such as hours, minutes, days, and seconds, as well as milliseconds and microseconds.
