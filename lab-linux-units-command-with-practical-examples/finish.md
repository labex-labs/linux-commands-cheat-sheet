# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the `units` command in Linux, which is a versatile tool for converting between different units of measurement. We learned how to install the `units` package, launch the interactive mode, and perform basic unit conversions and arithmetic operations. We then focused on converting between different time units, such as hours to minutes, days to seconds, and milliseconds to microseconds, using the `units` command.

The `units` command provides a comprehensive database of units, allowing us to easily convert between a wide range of measurements. It can be particularly useful for scientific, engineering, and everyday calculations.
