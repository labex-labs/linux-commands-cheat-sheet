# Perform Arithmetic Operations with units

In this final step, we will explore how to perform arithmetic operations using the `units` command.

The `units` command allows you to perform a variety of mathematical operations on units, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This can be particularly useful for scientific and engineering calculations.

Let's start by launching the `units` interactive mode again:

```bash
units
```

Now, let's try some arithmetic operations with units:

```
# Add 5 meters and 10 feet
> 5 meter + 10 foot
result is 7.6248 meter

# Subtract 3 kilograms from 10 pounds
> 10 pound - 3 kilogram
result is 4.8181818 pound

# Multiply 2 miles by 3 hours
> 2 mile * 3 hour
result is 6 mile_hour

# Divide 100 kilometers by 2 hours
> 100 kilometer / 2 hour
result is 50 kilometer/hour
```

Example output:

```
You have: 5 meter
You want: 10 foot
result is 7.6248 meter

You have: 10 pound
You want: 3 kilogram
result is 4.8181818 pound

You have: 2 mile
You want: 3 hour
result is 6 mile_hour

You have: 100 kilometer
You want: 2 hour
result is 50 kilometer/hour
```

As you can see, the `units` command allows you to perform a wide range of arithmetic operations on units, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The result is always displayed in the appropriate unit.

This can be particularly useful for complex calculations involving different units, as the `units` command handles the unit conversions automatically.
