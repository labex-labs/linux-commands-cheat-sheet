# Summary

In this lab, we learned the basics of the `tar` command in Linux, including how to create, extract, and manage archive files. We started by understanding the basic syntax and common options of the `tar` command, such as `-c` for creating a new archive, `-x` for extracting files, and `-v` for verbose output. We then created a simple tar archive and extracted its contents.

Next, we explored more advanced features of the `tar` command, including how to create and extract compressed archives using the `gzip` utility. We learned how to use the `-z` option to compress and decompress the archive, resulting in a `.tar.gz` file.
