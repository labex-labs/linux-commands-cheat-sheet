# Introduction

In this lab, we will introduce the GNU Debugger (gdb) and explore its usage for debugging C programs. gdb is a powerful tool that allows you to inspect the state of a running program, set breakpoints, and step through the code to identify and fix issues. We will start by ensuring that gdb is installed on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, then create a simple C program with a runtime error and use gdb to debug it. Finally, we will demonstrate how to debug a multithreaded C program using gdb.
