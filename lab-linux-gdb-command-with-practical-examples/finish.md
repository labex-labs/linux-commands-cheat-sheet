# Summary

In this lab, we introduced the GNU Debugger (gdb) and explored its usage for debugging C programs. We first ensured that gdb was installed on the Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, then created a simple C program with a runtime error to debug. We compiled the program with the `-g` flag to include debugging symbols, started the gdb debugger, set a breakpoint at the `main` function, and ran the program. Once the program hit the breakpoint, we were able to inspect variables, step through the code, and debug the issue.

The lab covered the basics of using gdb to debug a simple C program, as well as debugging a multithreaded C program. By following the step-by-step instructions, learners gained practical experience in using this powerful debugging tool.
