# Summary

In this lab, you first learned the basics of batch processing in Linux, which involves executing a series of commands without manual intervention to automate repetitive tasks. You created a simple Bash script to demonstrate the execution of multiple commands in sequence.

Next, you explored how to automate repetitive tasks using Bash scripts. You created a script that generates a list of files in the current directory and saves it to a file, demonstrating the power of Bash scripting to streamline your workflow and save time. Finally, you learned about using conditional statements and loops in batch processing, which allows for more advanced automation and decision-making within your scripts.
