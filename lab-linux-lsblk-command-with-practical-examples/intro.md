# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `lsblk` command, which is used to list information about block devices on the system. The `lsblk` command provides a tree-like listing of devices, making it easy to visualize the relationships between different storage devices and partitions. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `lsblk` command, then learn how to list all block devices on the system, and finally explore additional options and filters to customize the output.

The `lsblk` command is a useful tool for system administrators and developers who need to manage and monitor storage devices on their Linux systems. It can be used to quickly identify the storage devices available on the system, their types, sizes, and other relevant information.
