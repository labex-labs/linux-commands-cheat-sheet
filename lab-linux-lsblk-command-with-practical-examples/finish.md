# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `lsblk` command in Linux, which is used to list information about block devices on the system. The `lsblk` command provides a tree-like listing of devices, making it easy to visualize the relationships between different storage devices and partitions. We explored how to use the `lsblk` command to list all block devices on the system, including their names, device numbers, removability, size, read-only status, device type, and mount points. This information can be very useful when managing and troubleshooting storage devices on a Linux system.
