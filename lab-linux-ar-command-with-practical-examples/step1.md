# Understanding the ar Command

In this step, we will explore the Linux `ar` command, which is used to create, modify, and extract content from static libraries. Static libraries are archives of object files that can be linked into programs to provide functionality.

Let's start by understanding the basic usage of the `ar` command:

```bash
sudo ar --help
```

Example output:

```
Usage: ar [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE [MEMBERS]...
Modify an archive file

 The most commonly used options for the "ar" command are:

 -a            add files to the end of the archive
 -c            create the archive if it does not already exist
 -d            delete files from the archive
 -p            print the contents of the specified files
 -r            insert or replace files in the archive
 -t            display a table of contents of the archive
 -x            extract files from the archive
```

As you can see, the `ar` command provides various options to manage static libraries. Let's go through some of the common use cases.
