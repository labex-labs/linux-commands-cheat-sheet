# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Linux `ar` command to create, modify, and extract content from static libraries. We started by understanding the basic usage of the `ar` command and its various options. Then, we created a simple C file, compiled it into an object file, and used the `ar` command to create a static library from the object file. We also learned how to list the contents of the static library using the `ar` command. Overall, this lab provided a practical introduction to working with static libraries on a Linux system.
