# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `ar` command, which is used to create, modify, and extract content from static libraries. Static libraries are archives of object files that can be linked into programs to provide functionality. We will learn how to create static libraries, extract and list their contents, and understand the basic usage of the `ar` command. The lab covers key skills in the area of compression and archiving on Linux systems.
