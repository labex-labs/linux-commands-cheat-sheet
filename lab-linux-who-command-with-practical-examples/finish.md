# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `who` command in Linux, which is a powerful tool for displaying information about currently logged-in users. We learned that the `who` command provides details such as the username, terminal, login time, and the remote host from which the user has logged in. We also discovered various options that can be used with the `who` command to customize the output, such as displaying a more detailed view, adding a header line, or showing only the usernames. Additionally, we learned how to use the `who am i` command to display information about the current user.
