# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `sfdisk` command, a powerful tool for managing disk partitions. We will learn how to use `sfdisk` to create, delete, and modify disk partitions without the need for a graphical user interface. We will also cover how to backup and restore partition tables using `sfdisk`. This lab is designed to provide practical examples and hands-on experience with the `sfdisk` command, which is a valuable skill for system administrators and Linux enthusiasts.
