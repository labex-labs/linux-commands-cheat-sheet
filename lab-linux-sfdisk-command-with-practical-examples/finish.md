# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `sfdisk` command, a powerful tool for managing disk partitions in Linux. You explored the basic usage of `sfdisk`, including checking the version, listing current partitions, and creating a new partition table on a disk. You learned how to create a new DOS-style partition table with a single Linux partition that occupies the entire disk. This hands-on experience with `sfdisk` provides a solid foundation for managing disk partitions in a Linux environment.
