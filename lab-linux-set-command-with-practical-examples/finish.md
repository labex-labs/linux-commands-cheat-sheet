# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `set` command in Linux. The `set` command is used to set, unset, and display shell variables and options. You explored the various options that can be used with the `set` command, such as `-a`, `-e`, `-u`, and `-x`, and how to display all the currently set shell variables by running the `set` command without any arguments.

You also learned how to manage environment variables with the `set` command, which allows you to modify shell variables and control their behavior within the shell environment.
