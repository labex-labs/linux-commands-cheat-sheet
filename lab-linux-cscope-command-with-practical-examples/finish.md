# Summary

In this lab, we first installed the cscope tool on the Ubuntu 22.04 environment, which is a popular source code browsing and navigation tool. We then learned the basics of cscope, including how to use it to perform source code navigation, such as searching for definitions, references, and functions.

The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions on how to effectively use cscope to improve productivity when working with large codebases. By the end of the lab, users should have a good understanding of the capabilities of cscope and how to leverage it to enhance their source code exploration and analysis workflows.
