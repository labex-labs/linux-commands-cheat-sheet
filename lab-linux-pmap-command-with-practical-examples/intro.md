# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `pmap` command, a powerful tool for analyzing the memory usage of running processes. The lab will cover understanding the `pmap` command, analyzing memory usage of a process, and identifying potential memory leaks. The `pmap` command provides a detailed breakdown of the memory segments used by a process, including the starting address, size, permissions, and associated files or libraries. This information can be invaluable for optimizing application performance and identifying memory-related issues. The lab will guide you through practical examples and use cases for the `pmap` command, helping you develop essential system monitoring and management skills.
