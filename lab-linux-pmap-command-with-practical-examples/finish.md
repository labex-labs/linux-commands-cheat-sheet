# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `pmap` command, which provides detailed information about the memory usage of a running process. We learned how to use the `pmap` command to analyze the memory usage of a process, including identifying the memory segments, their sizes, and the associated files or libraries. This information can be valuable for understanding the memory footprint of your applications and identifying potential memory leaks.

Additionally, we discussed how the `pmap` command can be used to identify memory leaks in your applications. By regularly monitoring the memory usage of your processes using `pmap`, you can detect any unexpected increases in memory usage, which may indicate a memory leak. This can help you troubleshoot and resolve performance issues in your applications.
