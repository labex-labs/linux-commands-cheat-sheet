# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `expect` command to automate interactive command-line applications, such as SSH, FTP, and more. You will start by understanding the purpose and syntax of the `expect` command, then move on to automating SSH login and handling prompts and responses in `expect` scripts.

The lab covers the following steps:

- Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the expect Command
- Automate SSH Login with expect
- Handle Prompts and Responses in Expect Scripts

The `expect` command is a powerful tool that allows you to create scripts to automate repetitive tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention. In the first step, you will install the `expect` package and explore the basic syntax of the `expect` command. In the subsequent steps, you will learn how to use `expect` to automate SSH login and handle various prompts and responses in your scripts.
