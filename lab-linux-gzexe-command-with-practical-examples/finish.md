# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and functionality of the `gzexe` command in Linux, which is used to compress executable files to save disk space. You then demonstrated how to compress an executable file using `gzexe` and verified the reduced file size. Finally, you learned how to decompress and execute the compressed executable file directly, without the need for decompression.
