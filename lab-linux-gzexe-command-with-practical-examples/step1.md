# Understand the Purpose and Functionality of gzexe Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and functionality of the `gzexe` command in Linux. The `gzexe` command is used to compress executable files, reducing their size and saving disk space.

The `gzexe` command works by creating a compressed version of the executable file, which can then be executed directly without the need to decompress it first. This can be useful when you need to distribute or store executable files, as the compressed version will take up less space.

Let's start by checking the version of `gzexe` installed on your system:

```bash
gzexe --version
```

Example output:

```
gzexe (GNU gzip) 1.10

The `gzexe` command is part of the `gzip` package, which is a popular compression utility in Linux. It allows you to compress executable files without affecting their functionality.
