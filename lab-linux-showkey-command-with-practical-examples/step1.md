# Understand the Purpose of the showkey Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `showkey` command in Linux. The `showkey` command is a utility that allows you to capture and display the key codes generated by your keyboard. This can be useful for troubleshooting keyboard-related issues or understanding how your keyboard is communicating with the system.

To begin, let's start the `showkey` command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo showkey
```

Example output:

```
Press any keys - Ctrl-C to end
key pressed 1 is 65 (a)
key pressed 2 is 66 (b)
key pressed 3 is 67 (c)
^C
```

The `showkey` command will continue to run and display the key codes for every key you press on your keyboard. The output shows the decimal code for each key, as well as the corresponding character in parentheses.

The `showkey` command can be useful in several scenarios:

1. **Troubleshooting keyboard issues**: If you're experiencing problems with your keyboard, such as certain keys not working or unexpected behavior, the `showkey` command can help you identify the root cause by showing the key codes being generated.

2. **Mapping custom keyboard shortcuts**: If you want to create custom keyboard shortcuts or macros, the `showkey` output can help you determine the key codes to use in your configuration.

3. **Debugging keyboard-related applications**: Developers working on applications that interact with the keyboard can use `showkey` to understand the key codes their program is receiving.

To exit the `showkey` command, press `Ctrl+C`.
