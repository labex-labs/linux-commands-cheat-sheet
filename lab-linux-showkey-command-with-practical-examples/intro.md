# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `showkey` command and its practical applications. The `showkey` command is a utility that allows you to capture and display the key codes generated by your keyboard, which can be useful for troubleshooting keyboard-related issues or understanding how your keyboard communicates with the system. We will learn how to use the `showkey` command to capture keyboard input and analyze the output. This lab is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of the `showkey` command and its use cases.
