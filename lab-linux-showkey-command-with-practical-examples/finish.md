# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the Linux `showkey` command. The `showkey` command allows us to capture and display the key codes generated by the keyboard, which can be useful for troubleshooting keyboard-related issues, mapping custom keyboard shortcuts, and debugging keyboard-related applications. We started the `showkey` command in the terminal and observed the output, which showed the decimal code for each key pressed, as well as the corresponding character. This information can be valuable for understanding how the keyboard is communicating with the system.
