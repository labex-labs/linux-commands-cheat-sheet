# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is a widely used method for securely connecting to remote Linux servers. You verified the SSH server status on the Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container and successfully connected to the remote server using the SSH command. Additionally, you explored various SSH connection options, such as executing commands remotely, opening an interactive shell, and connecting to the server using a specific port.

Furthermore, you learned how to transfer files between the local and remote hosts using the Secure Copy (SCP) command. This allows you to securely copy files and directories between your local machine and the remote server, ensuring the privacy and integrity of your data.
