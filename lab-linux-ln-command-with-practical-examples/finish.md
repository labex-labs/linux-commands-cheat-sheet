# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `ln` command in Linux, which is used to create links that point to other files or directories. You explored the two types of links: hard links and symbolic (soft) links. Hard links are essentially copies of the original file that share the same inode and physical storage location, while symbolic links are pointers to the original file or directory and can cross file system boundaries. You also learned how to create hard links and symbolic links using the `ln` command.
