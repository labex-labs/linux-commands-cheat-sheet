# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to manage swap space in Linux using the `swapon` command. Swap space is a reserved area on the hard disk that the operating system can use when the system runs out of RAM. You will start by understanding the concept of swap space, then check the current swap space usage and configuration, and finally create and enable a new swap file. The lab covers practical examples and provides step-by-step guidance to help you effectively manage swap space on your Linux system.
