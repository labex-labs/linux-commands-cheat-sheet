# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the concept of swap space in Linux, which is a reserved area on a hard disk that the operating system can use when the system runs out of RAM. You also learned how to check the current swap space usage and configuration using the `free` command. Finally, you learned how to create and enable a swap file, which can be useful if you need additional swap space beyond what is provided by a swap partition.
