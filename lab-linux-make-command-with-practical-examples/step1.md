# Understand the Purpose and Syntax of the make Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose and syntax of the `make` command in Linux. The `make` command is a tool used to automate the process of building and compiling software from source code.

First, let's understand the purpose of the `make` command. The `make` command reads a file called a "Makefile" that contains instructions on how to build a program or project. The Makefile specifies the dependencies between the different source files, as well as the commands needed to compile and link the program.

The basic syntax of the `make` command is:

```
make [target]
```

Where `[target]` is the name of the target you want to build. If no target is specified, `make` will build the first target defined in the Makefile.

Here's an example of a simple Makefile:

```makefile
all: hello

hello: hello.c
    gcc -o hello hello.c
```

In this example, the `all` target depends on the `hello` target, which in turn depends on the `hello.c` source file. When you run `make`, it will compile the `hello.c` file and create the `hello` executable.

Let's try it out. First, create the `hello.c` file:

```
nano hello.c
```

Add the following content:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Save and exit the editor.

Now, run the `make` command:

```
make
```

Example output:

```
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

The `make` command has compiled the `hello.c` file and created the `hello` executable.
