# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `make` command to automate the process of building and compiling software from source code. You will start by understanding the purpose and syntax of the `make` command, then create a simple Makefile and compile a C program. Finally, you will explore the use of Makefile variables and targets.

The lab covers essential skills in the Scripting and Programming domain, providing practical examples and hands-on experience with the `make` command. The steps outlined in the lab will guide you through the process of setting up a Makefile, managing dependencies, and efficiently compiling your C program.
