# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `make` command in Linux, which is used to automate the process of building and compiling software from source code. You created a simple Makefile and used it to compile a C program, understanding how to define dependencies and build targets. Additionally, you explored the use of Makefile variables and targets to make the build process more flexible and reusable.
