# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `fdformat` command, which is used to low-level format a floppy disk. We will learn the purpose and syntax of the `fdformat` command, how to format a floppy disk using it, and how to verify the formatted disk and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This lab covers essential disk and file system utilities in the Linux operating system.

The `fdformat` command is a useful tool for preparing floppy disks for use, as it creates the necessary file system structure on the disk. However, it's worth noting that floppy disks are now considered outdated storage media, and the `fdformat` command may not be widely used in modern computing environments.
