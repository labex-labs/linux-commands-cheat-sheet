# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and syntax of the `fdformat` command in Linux, which is used to low-level format a floppy disk. We explored the basic command structure and common options, such as suppressing the final verification pass, verifying the formatting, and formatting the disk quietly. We then demonstrated how to actually format a floppy disk using the `fdformat` command, including the steps to insert the disk and run the command. Finally, we discussed the need to verify the formatted floppy disk and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the formatting process.
