# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `rwho` command in Linux, which is used to display information about users currently logged in to the local and remote systems on the local network. You explored the output of the `rwho` command, which provides details such as the username, terminal device, hostname, login time, idle time, and location of the user's terminal. This information can be useful for monitoring user activity and troubleshooting issues related to user logins and remote access.
