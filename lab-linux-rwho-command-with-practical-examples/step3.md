# Utilize the rwho Command for User Monitoring

In this step, you will learn how to utilize the `rwho` command for user monitoring and system management.

One common use case for the `rwho` command is to monitor user activity on your network. You can use the `rwho` command to regularly check which users are currently logged in, and how long they have been idle.

Let's try this out by running the `rwho` command in a loop:

```
$ while true; do rwho; sleep 5; done
```

This will continuously display the output of the `rwho` command every 5 seconds, allowing you to monitor user activity in real-time.

Example output:

```
User     tty    host    login@       idle    where
labex    pts/0  host1   10:15        0:01    host1
john     pts/1  host2   09:30        1:30    host2
jane     pts/2  host3   11:45        0:15    host3
```

You can use this information to identify any unusual user activity, such as users logging in at unusual times or staying idle for extended periods. This can be useful for detecting potential security issues or troubleshooting user-related problems.

Another way to utilize the `rwho` command is to integrate it into your system monitoring and automation workflows. For example, you could write a script that periodically checks the `rwho` output and sends an alert if it detects any suspicious user activity.

By understanding and utilizing the `rwho` command, you can enhance your ability to monitor and manage user activity on your Linux systems.
