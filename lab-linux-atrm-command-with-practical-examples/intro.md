# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `atrm` command, which allows you to remove scheduled tasks. The lab covers the introduction to the `atrm` command, how to remove scheduled tasks using `atrm`, and troubleshooting techniques for managing scheduled tasks. The `at` package, which is required for the `atrm` command, may need to be installed on your Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container before proceeding with the lab.
