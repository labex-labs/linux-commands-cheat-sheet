# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `atrm` command in Linux, which allows you to remove scheduled tasks. We first learned how to install the `at` package and create a sample scheduled task using the `at` command. We then used the `atrm` command to remove the scheduled task. Next, we created multiple scheduled tasks and learned how to remove them individually using the `atrm` command and the job ID. Finally, we discussed how to troubleshoot any issues with scheduled tasks by checking the task queue and removing tasks as needed.
