# Summary

In this lab, you learned the syntax and options of the `dd` command in Linux, which is a powerful tool for low-level data manipulation and creating backup images of storage devices. You explored the basic command structure, including the `if` (input file), `of` (output file), and various options like `bs` (block size), `count` (number of blocks), `conv` (data conversions), and `status` (progress display). You then learned how to create a backup image of a USB drive by identifying the device and using the `dd` command to copy the data to an image file. Finally, you discovered how to restore the backup image to a USB drive, ensuring that the data is replicated accurately.
