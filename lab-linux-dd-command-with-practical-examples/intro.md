# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the powerful `dd` command in Linux to create backup images of storage devices, such as USB drives, and restore them. The lab covers the syntax and options of the `dd` command, as well as practical examples of creating and restoring backup images. This lab is part of the Disk and File System Utilities skill set, which is essential for system administrators and power users who need to perform low-level data manipulation tasks.

The lab starts by explaining the syntax and options of the `dd` command, including how to specify the input and output files or devices, set the block size, and control the status updates during the copy process. Then, it demonstrates how to create a backup image of a USB drive and restore that image to another USB drive. The lab assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access the storage devices on your system.
