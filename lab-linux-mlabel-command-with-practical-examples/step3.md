# Explore Advanced mlabel Command Options and Scenarios

In this step, you will explore some advanced options and scenarios for the `mlabel` command.

One advanced option is the `-i` or `--ignore-errors` flag, which allows you to ignore any errors that may occur during the volume label operation. This can be useful if you're working with a file system that may have issues or if you want to force a label change even if there are potential problems.

Let's try an example where we intentionally create an invalid volume label:

```
sudo mlabel -c "My Invalid Label*" /dev/sdb1
Example output:
mlabel: Volume label "My Invalid Label*" is not valid
```

As you can see, the `mlabel` command refuses to set the volume label because it contains an invalid character (`*`). However, we can use the `-i` option to ignore this error:

```
sudo mlabel -i -c "My Invalid Label*" /dev/sdb1
Example output:
Volume label set to "My Invalid Label*"
```

Now, the volume label has been set, even though it contains an invalid character.

Another advanced scenario is using the `mlabel` command on a mounted file system. While this is generally not recommended, as it's better to manage volume labels on unmounted file systems, you can still do it if necessary:

```
# Mount the file system
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

# Change the volume label
sudo mlabel -c "Mounted Volume" /mnt
Example output:
Volume label set to "Mounted Volume"

# Unmount the file system
sudo umount /mnt
```

In this example, we first mount the `/dev/sdb1` file system to the `/mnt` directory, then change the volume label using the `mlabel` command, and finally unmount the file system.

Remember, as with any file system operations, it's important to be cautious and ensure that you're working with the correct devices and file systems to avoid data loss or corruption.
