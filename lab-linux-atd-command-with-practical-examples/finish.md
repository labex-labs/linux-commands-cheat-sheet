# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to monitor and control scheduled tasks using the `at` command. You can view the list of scheduled tasks with the `atq` command, remove a task with the `atrm` command, and view the details of a scheduled task with the `at -c [job_id]` command. This allows you to manage your scheduled tasks effectively and ensure they are executed as planned.
