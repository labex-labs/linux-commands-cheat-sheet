# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `setleds` command in Linux to control the state of the keyboard LED indicators, such as the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock LEDs. You will explore how to query the current LED state, set the LED state, and save the LED state as the default for future sessions. Additionally, you will learn how to automate keyboard LED state changes using shell scripts, which can be useful for various system configuration and settings tasks.
