# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the `setleds` command in Linux. The `setleds` command allows us to query, set, and save the state of the keyboard LED indicators, such as the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock LEDs. We explored how to check the current LED state, turn individual LEDs on and off, and set the default LED state for future sessions. This command is useful for automating tasks that require specific LED states, such as ensuring the Num Lock LED is on by default when a terminal session starts.
