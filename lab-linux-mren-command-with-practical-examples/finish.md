# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `mren` command, a powerful tool for renaming multiple files in Linux. You started by creating sample files and then used `mren` to rename them based on patterns, including the use of regular expressions for more advanced file renaming operations. The `mren` command allows you to efficiently batch rename files, making it a valuable tool for file management tasks.

The lab covered the basic syntax of the `mren` command, demonstrating how to rename files with a specific prefix or pattern. Additionally, you explored the use of regular expressions with `mren`, which enables more complex file renaming scenarios, such as adding a consistent format to file names.
