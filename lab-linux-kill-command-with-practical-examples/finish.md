# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `kill` command in Linux, which is used to terminate or send signals to running processes. You started by running a long-running `sleep` process and then terminated it using the `kill` command with the process ID (PID). You also explored advanced options of the `kill` command, such as sending different signals to processes, terminating processes by their name, and using the `killall` command to terminate multiple processes at once.
