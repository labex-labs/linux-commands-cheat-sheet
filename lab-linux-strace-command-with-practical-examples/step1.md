# Introduction to strace Command

In this step, we will explore the strace command, a powerful tool in Linux that allows you to trace and monitor the system calls made by a running process. System calls are the interface between a process and the operating system, and understanding them can be crucial for debugging and troubleshooting issues.

Let's start by installing the strace package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y strace
```

Example output:

Now, let's try using the strace command to trace a simple program. We'll use the `ls` command as an example:

```bash
strace ls
```

Example output:

```
execve("/usr/bin/ls", ["ls"], 0x7ffee4f7a0f0 /* 23 vars */) = 0
brk(NULL)                               = 0x55b7d6c23000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
...
```

The output shows the sequence of system calls made by the `ls` command, including `execve` to execute the command, `brk` to allocate memory, `access` to check file permissions, and `openat` to open the dynamic linker cache file.

By analyzing the strace output, you can gain insights into how a program interacts with the operating system, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding program behavior.
