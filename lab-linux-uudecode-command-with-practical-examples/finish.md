# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `uudecode` command in Linux, which is used to decode files that have been encoded using the `uuencode` command. You created a sample text file, encoded it using `uuencode`, and then used `uudecode` to decode the file back to its original binary format. The `uudecode` command is a useful tool for transferring binary files over text-based communication channels, as it allows the recipient to decode the file on their end.
