# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose and usage of the Linux `banner` command. We learned how to display a custom message using the `banner` command, and how to customize the banner's appearance by specifying the width and font file. The `banner` command is a useful tool for creating eye-catching messages or banners in the terminal, and can be leveraged in terminal-based scripts or applications.
