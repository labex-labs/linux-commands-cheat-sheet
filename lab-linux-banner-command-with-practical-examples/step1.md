# Understand the Purpose of the banner Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose and usage of the `banner` command in Linux. The `banner` command is a utility that allows you to display text in a large, ASCII-art style format, making it useful for creating eye-catching messages or banners in the terminal.

Let's begin by running the `banner` command without any arguments:

```
$ banner
Usage: banner [-w width] [-f font-file] string
```

The output shows the basic syntax of the `banner` command, which includes options to specify the width of the banner and the font file to use. However, if you run the command without any arguments, it will simply display the usage information.

To see the `banner` command in action, let's try displaying a simple message:

```
$ banner "Hello, World!"
 _   _      _ _        __        __         _     _
| | | | ___| | | ___   \ \      / /__  _ __| | __| |
| |_| |/ _ \ | |/ _ \   \ \ /\ / / _ \| '__| |/ _` |
|  _  |  __/ | | (_) |   \ V  V / (_) | |  | | (_| |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/     \_/\_/ \___/|_|  |_|\__,_|
```

The `banner` command has taken the text "Hello, World!" and rendered it in a large, ASCII-art style format, making it easy to display prominent messages in the terminal.

The `banner` command can be a useful tool for creating custom banners, headers, or other visual elements in your terminal-based scripts or applications.
