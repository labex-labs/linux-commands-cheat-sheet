In this lab, we will explore the Linux `banner` command, which allows you to display text in a large, ASCII-art style format. This can be useful for creating eye-catching messages or banners in the terminal. We will cover how to understand the purpose of the `banner` command, display custom messages, and customize the banner's appearance. The `banner` command is a versatile tool that can be used in terminal-based scripts or applications to add visual elements.
