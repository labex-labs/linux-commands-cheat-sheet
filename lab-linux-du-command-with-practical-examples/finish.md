# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `du` (disk usage) command in Linux, which is used to estimate file space usage and provide information about the disk space occupied by files and directories. You explored the commonly used `du` options, such as `-h` for human-readable output, `-s` for displaying the total size of a directory, and `-d` for limiting the depth of the directory tree. You then practiced using the `du` command to measure the disk usage of a specific directory, both for the directory itself and for the individual files within it.
