# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `du` (disk usage) command in Linux to estimate file space usage and provide information about the disk space occupied by files and directories. You will understand the various options of the `du` command, measure the disk usage of a directory, and exclude directories from the `du` measurement. The lab covers the basic file and directory operations in Linux, which are essential for system administration and file management tasks.
