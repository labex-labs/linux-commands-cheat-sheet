# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to install and use the Subversion (SVN) version control system on an Ubuntu 22.04 environment. You will initialize a local SVN repository, commit changes, update the repository, and revert changes as needed. The lab covers the essential SVN commands and their practical applications, providing a solid foundation for managing source code and collaborating on projects using SVN.

The lab starts by installing the Subversion package on Ubuntu 22.04. It then guides you through the process of initializing a local SVN repository, allowing you to manage your project files and track changes over time. You will learn how to commit new changes, update the repository with the latest changes, and revert any unwanted modifications. This hands-on experience with SVN will equip you with the necessary skills to effectively use this version control system in your development workflows.
