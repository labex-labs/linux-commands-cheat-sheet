# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose of the `grpck` command in Linux, which is used to verify the integrity of the group file. We learned that the group file, located at `/etc/group`, stores information about the various groups on the system, including the group name, group ID, and the list of users that belong to each group. Over time, this file can become corrupted or inconsistent, leading to issues with group management and user permissions. The `grpck` command helps identify and repair any issues in the group file, ensuring that the group information is accurate and up-to-date.

We also demonstrated how to use the `grpck` command to check the integrity of the group file and how to display the contents of the `/etc/group` file using the `cat` command.
