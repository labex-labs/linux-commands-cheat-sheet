# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `grpck` command and its practical applications. The `grpck` command is used to verify the integrity of the group file, which is responsible for managing user groups on the system. This is particularly important for maintaining the proper functioning of the system and ensuring that users have the correct group memberships. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `grpck` command, then proceed to verify the group file integrity and repair any issues that may arise.
