# Understand the bzless Command

In this step, you will learn about the `bzless` command, which is a tool used to view the contents of bzip2-compressed text files. The `bzless` command is similar to the `less` command, but it allows you to navigate through compressed files without having to decompress them first.

To get started, let's first create a sample bzip2-compressed file:

```bash
echo "This is a sample text file." | bzip2 > sample.txt.bz2
```

Now, let's use the `bzless` command to view the contents of the compressed file:

```bash
bzless sample.txt.bz2
```

You should see the following output:

```
This is a sample text file.
```

The `bzless` command allows you to navigate through the compressed file just like you would with the `less` command. You can use the following key combinations to navigate:

- `Spacebar`: Scroll down one page
- `b`: Scroll up one page
- `G`: Go to the end of the file
- `g`: Go to the beginning of the file
- `/`: Search for a pattern
- `n`: Go to the next search result
- `q`: Quit the `bzless` command
