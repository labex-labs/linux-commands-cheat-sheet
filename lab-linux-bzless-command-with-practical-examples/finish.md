# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `bzless` command, which is used to view the contents of bzip2-compressed text files. You explored the various options available with the `bzless` command, such as displaying line numbers, setting the number of lines to display per page, and searching for a specific pattern within the compressed file. You also learned how to navigate through the compressed file using the `bzless` command, similar to the `less` command, without having to decompress the file first.
