# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `traceroute` command, a network diagnostic tool used to trace the network path to a destination. You will start by ensuring the `traceroute` command is installed on your system, then use it to trace the network path to a website, and finally explore how `traceroute` can be used to troubleshoot network issues. The lab covers the essential steps for understanding and utilizing the `traceroute` command in a practical setting.

The `traceroute` command sends packets to a destination and displays the route the packets take, along with the time it takes for each hop. This information can be valuable for identifying network problems and understanding the network topology. If the `traceroute` command is not installed on your system, you will need to install it using the provided commands.
