# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `traceroute` command in Linux, which is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the network path to a destination. You started by installing the `traceroute` command on your system, and then used it to trace the network path to the `www.example.com` website. The output of the `traceroute` command showed the IP addresses and response times for each hop along the network path. The `traceroute` command can be a valuable tool for troubleshooting network issues, as it can help you identify where in the network path a problem may be occurring.
