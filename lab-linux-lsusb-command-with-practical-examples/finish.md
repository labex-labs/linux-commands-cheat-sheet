# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose and basic usage of the lsusb command in Linux. The lsusb command allows you to list information about the USB devices connected to your system, including the bus number, device number, vendor ID, product ID, device class, subclass, and protocol. You can use the lsusb command with the -v option to display more detailed information about each USB device. Additionally, you can search for a specific USB device by its vendor and product ID using the lsusb command.
