# Summary

In this lab, we first introduced the zypper command, which is the default package manager for SUSE-based Linux distributions. We learned how to check the version of zypper, explore the available subcommands, and understand the most commonly used zypper commands for installing, updating, searching, and removing packages. We then demonstrated how to install a new package, the `htop` system monitoring tool, using the `zypper install` command. Finally, we covered how to update packages with the `zypper update` command.
