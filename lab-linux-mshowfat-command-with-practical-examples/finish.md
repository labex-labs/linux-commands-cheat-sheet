# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `mshowfat` command, a tool used to display information about the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system structure. You explored the basic usage of `mshowfat`, including checking the installed version and displaying detailed file system information on a storage device. You also learned how to create a sample FAT-formatted USB drive and use `mshowfat` to analyze its file system structure, such as the cluster size, number of FATs, and the total number of clusters.

Additionally, you gained an understanding of how the `mshowfat` command can be particularly useful for analyzing and troubleshooting issues related to FAT-based storage devices, without the need to mount the file system.
