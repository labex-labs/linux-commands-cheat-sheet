# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `write` command in Linux, which allows you to send a message to another user who is currently logged in to the same system. You also learned how to send a message to a specific user on the same system using the `write` command followed by the username of the recipient. Additionally, you explored how to broadcast a message to all logged-in users on the system.

The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and apply the `write` command effectively. By the end of the lab, you should have a solid grasp of how to use the `write` command to communicate with other users on the same Linux system.
