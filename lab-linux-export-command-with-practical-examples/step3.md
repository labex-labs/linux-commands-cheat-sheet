# Explore Practical Examples of the export Command

In this final step, we will explore some practical examples of using the `export` command.

One common use case for `export` is to set environment variables for your applications or scripts. For example, let's say you have a Python script that needs to access a database. You can set the database connection details as environment variables and use them in your script:

```bash
export DB_HOST="mydb.example.com"
export DB_USER="myuser"
export DB_PASS="mypassword"
export DB_NAME="mydbname"
```

Then, in your Python script, you can access these variables:

```python
import os

db_host = os.getenv("DB_HOST")
db_user = os.getenv("DB_USER")
db_pass = os.getenv("DB_PASS")
db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")

# Use the environment variables to connect to the database
```

Another example is setting the `PATH` environment variable to include custom directories. This can be useful if you have installed software in a non-standard location and need to make it accessible to your shell:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/myapp/bin
```

Now, any commands located in the `/opt/myapp/bin` directory can be executed without specifying the full path.

You can also use `export` to set environment variables for specific commands or scripts. For example, if you have a script that needs to run with a specific `PYTHONPATH` setting, you can set it using `export` before running the script:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/my/python/modules
python my_script.py
```

This ensures that the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set correctly for the duration of the script execution.

Remember, environment variables set using `export` are only available within the current shell session. If you want to make them persistent, you should add the `export` commands to your shell's startup script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
