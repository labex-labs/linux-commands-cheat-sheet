# Summary

In this lab, we explored the mtoolstest command, which is a utility for testing the functionality of the mtools package in Linux. We started by verifying the installation of the mtools package on our Ubuntu 22.04 system, and then proceeded to learn about the practical examples of using the mtoolstest command. The mtoolstest command is used to test the various mtools commands, which are used for manipulating files on FAT/VFAT file systems, commonly found on removable storage devices.
