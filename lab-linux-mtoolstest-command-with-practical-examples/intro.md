# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the mtoolstest command, a utility for testing the functionality of the mtools package in Linux. The mtools package provides a set of tools for manipulating files on FAT/VFAT file systems, commonly used on removable storage devices. We will verify the installation of mtoolstest on Ubuntu 22.04 and walk through practical examples of using the command to ensure the proper configuration and functionality of the mtools package.
