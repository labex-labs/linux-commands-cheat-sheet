# Practical Examples of Using mtoolstest Command

Now that we have verified the installation of the mtoolstest command, let's explore some practical examples of how to use it.

First, let's test the `mformat` command, which is used to format a FAT/VFAT file system on a storage device:

```bash
mtoolstest -m
```

Example output:

```
Formatting drive a: as FAT12 filesystem
Formatting drive a: as FAT16 filesystem
Formatting drive a: as FAT32 filesystem
```

The output shows that the mtoolstest command successfully tested the `mformat` command for different FAT file system types.

Next, let's test the `mread` and `mwrite` commands, which are used to read from and write to a FAT/VFAT file system:

```bash
mtoolstest -r
mtoolstest -w
```

Example output:

```
Reading from drive a:
Writing to drive a:
```

The output confirms that the `mread` and `mwrite` commands are working as expected.

Finally, let's test the `mls` and `mdir` commands, which are used to list the contents of a FAT/VFAT file system:

```bash
mtoolstest -l
mtoolstest -D
```

Example output:

```
Listing contents of drive a:
Listing directory contents of drive a:
```

The output shows that the `mls` and `mdir` commands are also functioning correctly.

By running the mtoolstest command with different options, we have verified the basic functionality of the mtools package, including the ability to format, read, write, and list the contents of a FAT/VFAT file system.
