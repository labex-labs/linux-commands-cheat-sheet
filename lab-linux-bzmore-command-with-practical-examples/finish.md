# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the `bzmore` command, which is used to view the contents of compressed text files in the `.bz2` format. You created a sample `.bz2` file and used the `bzmore` command to view its contents, understanding how to navigate through the file using commands like the spacebar, Enter key, and `q`. You then explored the various functionalities of the `bzmore` command, creating a larger compressed file and using different options to customize the viewing experience, such as clearing the screen, displaying control characters, and suppressing line numbering.
