# Explore the Functionality of bzmore

In this step, you will explore the various functionalities of the `bzmore` command.

First, let's create a larger compressed file to work with:

```bash
# Create a larger text file
head -n 1000 /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' > large.txt

# Compress the file using bzip2
bzip2 large.txt
```

Now, let's use the `bzmore` command to view the contents of the compressed file:

```bash
bzmore large.txt.bz2
```

You can use the following commands to navigate through the file:

- Press the spacebar to view the next page
- Press the Enter key to view the next line
- Type `q` to quit

You can also use the following options with the `bzmore` command:

- `-c`: Clear the screen before displaying each page
- `-d`: Display control characters instead of skipping them
- `-l`: Suppress the default pause at the end of each page
- `-n`: Suppress the default line numbering

Try using these options and observe the differences in the output:

```bash
bzmore -c large.txt.bz2
bzmore -d large.txt.bz2
bzmore -l large.txt.bz2
bzmore -n large.txt.bz2
```

The `bzmore` command can be a useful tool when working with compressed text files, as it allows you to view the contents without having to decompress the file first.
