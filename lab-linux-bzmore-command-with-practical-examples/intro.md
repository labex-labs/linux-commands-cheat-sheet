# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the `bzmore` command, which is used to view the contents of compressed text files in the `.bz2` format. The `bzmore` command is similar to the `more` command, but it can handle compressed files. You will explore the functionality of the `bzmore` command, including navigating through the compressed file and using various options to customize the output. The lab provides practical examples to help you understand the usage of the `bzmore` command, which can be useful when working with large compressed files.
