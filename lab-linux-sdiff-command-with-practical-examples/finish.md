# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and syntax of the `sdiff` command in Linux, which is used to compare and merge text files. We explored the various options available for customizing the output of the `sdiff` command, such as suppressing common lines, setting the output width, and listing only the left or right side of the differences. We then used the `sdiff` command to compare two sample text files, highlighting the differences between them and understanding how the command can be used to identify and merge changes.
