# Prepare the Development Environment for autoreconf

In this step, we will prepare the development environment for using the `autoreconf` command. We will install the necessary build tools and dependencies required for the GNU Autotools build system.

First, let's update the package lists and install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake libtool
```

Example output:

```

```

The `autoconf`, `automake`, and `libtool` packages are the core components of the GNU Autotools build system. These tools work together to generate the necessary build system files, such as `configure` scripts and `Makefile`s, for a software project.

Now, let's verify that the packages were installed correctly:

```bash
which autoconf
which automake
which libtool
```

Example output:

```
/usr/bin/autoconf
/usr/bin/automake
/usr/bin/libtool
```

The output shows that the required packages have been installed and are available in the system's `PATH`.

With the development environment set up, we're now ready to use the `autoreconf` command in the next step.
