# Summary

In this lab, we explored the purpose of the `autoreconf` command in Linux, which is used to automatically generate the necessary build system files for a software project, such as `configure` scripts and `Makefile`s. We created a sample project directory, set up a basic `configure.ac` file, and then ran the `autoreconf` command to generate the required build system files. This process is essential for projects that use the GNU Autotools build system, as it helps to create a standardized build process that can be used across different platforms.
