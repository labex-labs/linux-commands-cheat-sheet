In this lab, you learned about the logrotate command in Linux, which is a utility that helps manage log files by automatically rotating, compressing, and deleting old log files. You explored the basic usage of the logrotate command, including checking the version, viewing the default configuration, and manually rotating log files. Additionally, you configured logrotate to manage the Apache web server logs, creating a custom logrotate configuration file and understanding the various options available for log rotation.
