# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `poweroff` command to safely shut down your system and automate the shutdown process using Cron. The `poweroff` command is used to gracefully power off the system, ensuring that all running processes are terminated and the file system is properly unmounted. You will also explore how to schedule automatic system shutdowns using Cron, a time-based job scheduler. This lab provides practical examples and step-by-step guidance to help you effectively manage your system's power-off operations.
