# Understand the Concept of Software RAID

In this step, you will learn about the concept of software RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) and how it differs from hardware RAID. Software RAID is a feature provided by the operating system that allows you to create and manage RAID arrays using software instead of dedicated RAID controller hardware.

The main advantage of software RAID is that it is more cost-effective and flexible than hardware RAID. It can be implemented on any system with multiple storage devices, without the need for specialized RAID hardware. However, software RAID may have slightly lower performance compared to hardware RAID, as the CPU is responsible for managing the RAID operations.

There are several RAID levels that you can configure using software RAID, such as RAID 0 (striping), RAID 1 (mirroring), RAID 5 (striping with distributed parity), and RAID 6 (striping with dual distributed parity). Each RAID level offers different trade-offs between storage capacity, performance, and data redundancy.

In the next step, you will learn how to create a software RAID array using the `mdadm` command in Linux.
