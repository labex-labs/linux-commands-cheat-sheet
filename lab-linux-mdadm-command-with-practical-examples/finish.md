# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the concept of software RAID, which allows you to create and manage RAID arrays using software instead of dedicated hardware. You explored the advantages of software RAID, such as cost-effectiveness and flexibility, as well as the different RAID levels available. Then, you learned how to create a software RAID array using the `mdadm` command in Linux. You created four virtual block devices and used them to set up a RAID 5 array, which provides data redundancy and improved performance.
