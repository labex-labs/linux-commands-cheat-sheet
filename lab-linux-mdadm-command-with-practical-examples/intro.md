# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `mdadm` command to create, manage, and monitor software RAID arrays. Software RAID is a cost-effective and flexible alternative to hardware RAID, allowing you to configure various RAID levels without the need for specialized hardware. You will first understand the concept of software RAID and how it differs from hardware RAID. Then, you will create a RAID 5 array using the `mdadm` command and virtual block devices. Finally, you will learn how to manage and monitor the software RAID array.
