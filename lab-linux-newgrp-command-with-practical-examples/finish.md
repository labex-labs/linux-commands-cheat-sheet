# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `newgrp` command in Linux, which allows you to change the primary group membership of the current shell session. You explored how to use `newgrp` to switch to a different group, and how this affects the ownership of new files and directories created in the current session. Additionally, you learned how to create a new group and switch to it using the `newgrp` command, which is useful when you need to perform tasks that require the permissions of a specific group.
