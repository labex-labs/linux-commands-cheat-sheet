# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `gunzip` command and its practical applications. The `gunzip` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the `gzip` utility, a popular compression tool in Linux. We will start by understanding the purpose of the `gunzip` command, then learn how to decompress a single gzipped file, and finally, explore how to recursively decompress directories. This lab will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of working with compressed files in Linux using the `gunzip` command.
