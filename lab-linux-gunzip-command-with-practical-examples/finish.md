# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose of the `gunzip` command in Linux, which is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the `gzip` compression utility. We created sample text files, compressed them with `gzip`, and then used `gunzip` to decompress the files back to their original state. We also learned that `gunzip` can be used to decompress individual files or entire directories of compressed files.
