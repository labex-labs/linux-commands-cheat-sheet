# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `gpasswd` command in Linux, which is used to administer the `/etc/group` file and the `/etc/gshadow` file. We explored how to add a user to a group, remove a user from a group, and manage group passwords using the `gpasswd` command. We created a new group called "developers" and added a user "labex" to it, then verified the user's membership in the group. Finally, we learned how to remove a user from a group using the `gpasswd` command.
