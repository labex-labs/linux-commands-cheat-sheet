# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the powerful tcpdump command to capture and analyze network traffic on a Linux system. The tcpdump command is a widely-used network packet analyzer tool that allows you to monitor and inspect network packets in real-time, making it a valuable tool for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and understanding network behavior. The lab will cover the basics of using tcpdump, including capturing network traffic and filtering the output to focus on specific types of network activity.
