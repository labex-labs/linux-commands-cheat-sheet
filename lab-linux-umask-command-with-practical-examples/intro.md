# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `umask` command, which is used to set the default permissions for newly created files and directories. We will start by understanding the `umask` command and how it works, then learn how to modify file and directory permissions using `umask` in different scenarios. This lab covers the essential aspects of user and permission management in a Linux environment.

The lab will guide you through the process of checking the current `umask` value, changing the `umask` to set different default permissions, and observing the effects on newly created files and directories. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the `umask` command to manage file and directory permissions effectively.
