# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `umask` command, which is used to set the default permissions for newly created files and directories. We learned that the `umask` value is a 4-digit octal number that represents the permissions that should not be granted. We also learned how to modify the default file and directory permissions using the `umask` command, and how to create new files and directories to observe the effect of `umask`. The lab provided practical examples to help us understand the usage and application of the `umask` command in different scenarios.
