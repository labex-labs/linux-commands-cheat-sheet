# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the fundamental file permissions in Linux and how to view and understand them. You discovered that every file and directory has a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, and execute the file or directory, which are divided into three categories: owner, group, and others. You also learned how to use the `ls -l` and `stat` commands to view the permissions of files and directories, and how understanding file permissions is essential for managing access to files and directories in a Linux system.
