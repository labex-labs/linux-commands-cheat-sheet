# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `uncompress` command and its practical applications. The lab covers the purpose of the `uncompress` command, which is used to decompress files compressed using the older `compress` command. We will learn how to use the `uncompress` command to decompress Gzipped files, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the compression and decompression process. This lab is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the `uncompress` command and its role in the Linux compression and archiving ecosystem.
