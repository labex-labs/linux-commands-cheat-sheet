# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the purpose of the `uncompress` command in Linux, which is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the older `compress` command. We then practiced using the `uncompress` command to decompress a Gzipped file, verifying the contents of the decompressed file. The lab provided a comprehensive understanding of the `uncompress` command and its practical applications in Linux.
