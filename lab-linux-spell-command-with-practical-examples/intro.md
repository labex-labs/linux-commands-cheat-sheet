# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `spell` command and its practical applications. We will start by understanding the purpose and functionality of the `spell` command, which is used to check the spelling of words in text files. Then, we will install the `spell` command on our Ubuntu 22.04 system and perform basic spell checking on sample text files. This lab will provide you with the knowledge and skills to effectively use the `spell` command to improve the quality of your written work.
