# Summary

In this lab, we first learned about the purpose and functionality of the `spell` command in Linux. The `spell` command is a utility used to check the spelling of words in a text file or input. We then installed the `spell` command on our Ubuntu 22.04 system by updating the package lists and installing the `spell` package. Finally, we performed basic spell checking on a sample text file using the `spell` command, which did not find any misspelled words.
