# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `wget` command in Linux, which is a powerful tool used to download files from the internet. You explored the common options used with `wget`, such as `-O` to save the downloaded file with a different name, `-P` to save the file in a specified directory, `-c` to continue a previously interrupted download, `-r` to download files recursively, and `-b` to run `wget` in the background. You also learned how to use `wget` to download files from the internet, including specifying the URL and observing the download progress, file size, and time taken to complete the download.

You then learned how to automate file downloads with `wget` scripting, which allows you to schedule and manage multiple file downloads more efficiently.
