# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the `accton` command in Linux, which is used to enable or disable accounting of process data. You explored how to start and stop the accounting system, as well as how to check its current status. Then, you learned how to use the `accton` command to manage network interface configuration changes, including adding a new IP address to a network interface and observing the changes in the accounting log.

The lab provided a practical understanding of the `accton` command and its applications in managing system and network configuration data on a Linux system.
