# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the Linux `accton` command, which is used to enable or disable accounting of process data. The lab covers understanding the `accton` command, managing network interface configuration using `accton`, and troubleshooting network issues with the command. We will learn how to start and stop the accounting system, as well as how to use `accton` to track changes to network configurations. This lab provides practical examples and insights into the effective use of the `accton` command in Linux environments.
