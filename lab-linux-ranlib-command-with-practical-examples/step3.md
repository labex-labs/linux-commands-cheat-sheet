# Verify the Updated Library Information

In this final step, we will verify the updated information in the static library we created in the previous step.

First, let's use the `nm` command to list the symbols defined in the static library:

```bash
nm libmylib.a
```

Example output:

```
0000000000000000 T myfunction
                 U __libc_start_main
                 U printf
```

The output shows that the static library contains a single symbol, `myfunction`, which is defined as a text (code) symbol.

Next, let's use the `ar` command to list the contents of the static library:

```bash
ar -t libmylib.a
```

Example output:

```
mylib.o
```

The output shows that the static library contains a single object file, `mylib.o`.

Finally, let's use the `ranlib` command to display the symbol table information for the static library:

```bash
ranlib -t libmylib.a
```

Example output:

```
mylib.o
```

The output shows that the `ranlib` command has updated the symbol table information for the static library.

Now, let's verify that the program we created in the previous step is still able to link against the static library and run correctly:

```bash
gcc -o main main.o -L. -lmylib
./main
```

Example output:

```
The answer is: 42
```

The program runs as expected, demonstrating that the static library and its symbol table information are correctly updated.
