# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `chpasswd` command in Linux to change user passwords in batch mode. We created a file with a list of user and password pairs, and used the `chpasswd` command to update the passwords accordingly. Additionally, we explored how to automate the process of changing user passwords using a shell script, which can be useful in corporate environments where passwords need to be regularly updated for a large number of users.

Finally, we learned how to create a shell script that uses the `chpasswd` command to change user passwords, and how to run the script to update the passwords for the users.
