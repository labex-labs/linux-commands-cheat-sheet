# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the Linux `chpasswd` command, which allows you to change user passwords in batch mode. The lab covers understanding the `chpasswd` command, changing user passwords in batch mode, and automating password changes using shell scripts. This can be particularly useful in corporate environments where you need to regularly update passwords for a large number of users. The lab provides practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you effectively manage user passwords in a Linux system.
