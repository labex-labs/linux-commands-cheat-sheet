# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install and update the aptitude package manager on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. We started by updating the package index to ensure we have the latest package information, and then installed the aptitude package manager. We also explored how to perform package searches and information lookups, as well as how to install, upgrade, and remove packages using aptitude.
