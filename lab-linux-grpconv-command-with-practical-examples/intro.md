# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `grpconv` command and its practical applications in user and permission management. The lab covers understanding the purpose and syntax of the `grpconv` command, creating and managing user groups using the command, and synchronizing group passwords with the `grpconv` command. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to effectively manage user groups and group passwords in a Linux environment.
