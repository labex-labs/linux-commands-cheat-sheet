# Create and Manage User Groups Using the grpconv Command

In this step, we will learn how to create and manage user groups using the `grpconv` command.

First, let's create a new group called "developers":

```
$ sudo groupadd developers
```

Now, let's add a few users to the "developers" group:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G developers labex
$ sudo usermod -a -G developers user1
$ sudo usermod -a -G developers user2
```

To verify the group membership, we can use the `id` command:

```
$ id labex
uid=1000(labex) gid=1000(labex) groups=1000(labex),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lxd),128(sambashare),999(developers)
```

As we can see, the `labex` user is now a member of the "developers" group.

Next, let's synchronize the group password file with the shadow group file using the `grpconv` command:

```
$ sudo grpconv
```

This will ensure that the group passwords in the `/etc/gshadow` file are in sync with the group information in the `/etc/group` file.
