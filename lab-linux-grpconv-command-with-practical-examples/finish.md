# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and syntax of the `grpconv` command, which is used to synchronize the group password file with the shadow group file. We learned that the `grpconv` command has a simple syntax and its main purpose is to enhance the security of group passwords.

Next, we created and managed user groups using the `grpconv` command. We learned how to create a new group, add users to the group, and verify the group membership. We also discussed the importance of synchronizing the group passwords using the `grpconv` command.
