# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the `mzip` command, which is a utility for compressing and extracting files and directories in Linux. You installed the `mtools` package, which provides the `mzip` command, and explored its basic usage and available options. Then, you learned how to use the `mzip` command to compress files and directories by creating a new archive file, and how to extract files from an existing archive.
