# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `fold` command in Linux, which is used to wrap text and break long lines into shorter ones. You explored how to use the `fold` command with different column widths to format text files, and how to combine it with other Linux commands for more advanced text manipulation tasks.

The key points covered in this lab include understanding the basic syntax of the `fold` command, using options like `-w` to specify the column width, and applying the `fold` command to text files to achieve the desired formatting. Additionally, you learned how to combine the `fold` command with other Linux tools, such as using it in a pipeline with other commands.
