# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `fold` command to wrap text, breaking long lines into shorter ones. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `fold` command, as well as how to use it to fold text files with different column widths. Additionally, you will learn how to combine the `fold` command with other Linux commands for more advanced text processing tasks.

The lab is divided into three main steps: understanding the purpose and syntax of the `fold` command, folding text files with different column widths, and combining the `fold` command with other Linux commands. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the `fold` command effectively for your text processing and editing needs.
