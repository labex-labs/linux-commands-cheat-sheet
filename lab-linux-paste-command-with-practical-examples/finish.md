# Summary

In this lab, we learned the basics of the `paste` command in Linux, which is used to combine multiple files horizontally, merging their corresponding lines into a single line. We explored how to customize the output of the `paste` command by using different delimiters, and how to combine multiple files in more advanced ways, such as combining them vertically or creating a matrix-like structure.

The lab provided practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help us understand the usage and capabilities of the `paste` command. By the end of the lab, we gained a solid understanding of how to effectively use the `paste` command to manipulate and combine data from multiple files in Linux.
