# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `nohup` command in Linux, which allows you to run a long-running process in the background, even after you log out of your terminal session. You started by running a simple `sleep 60` command using `nohup`, and then verified that the process was still running using the `ps` command. Next, you created a script that runs a long-running process and used `nohup` to run it in the background, with the output being saved to a file named `nohup.out`.
