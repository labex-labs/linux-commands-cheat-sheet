# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `nohup` command to run long-running processes in the background, even after you log out of your terminal session. You will understand the purpose of the `nohup` command, run a long-running process using `nohup`, and redirect the output to a file. This lab covers practical examples of process management in a Linux environment.

The `nohup` command allows you to run a process that will continue to execute even after you log out, preventing the process from being terminated. You will start by running a simple command using `nohup` and verifying that the process is still running. Then, you will create a script that runs a long-running process and use `nohup` to run it in the background, with the output saved to a file.
