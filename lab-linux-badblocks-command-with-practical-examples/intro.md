# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `badblocks` command, which is a utility used to scan a disk for bad blocks. The `badblocks` command can help identify and mark bad sectors on a disk, improving the reliability of your storage devices. We will learn how to perform a non-destructive read-only scan of a disk to detect any bad blocks, and how to repair them if necessary. The `badblocks` command is a powerful tool for maintaining the health of your storage systems.
