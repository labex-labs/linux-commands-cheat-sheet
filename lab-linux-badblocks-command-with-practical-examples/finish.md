# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Linux `badblocks` command, which is used to scan a disk for bad blocks. We started by exploring the different options available with the `badblocks` command, such as specifying the block size, the number of blocks to check at a time, and the type of test to perform. We then learned how to perform a non-destructive read-only scan of a disk to identify any bad blocks. Finally, we discussed how to repair bad blocks on a disk using the `badblocks` command.
