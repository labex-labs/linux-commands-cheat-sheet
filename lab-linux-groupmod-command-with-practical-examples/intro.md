# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `groupmod` command, which is used to modify the attributes of an existing group, such as the group name and Group ID (GID). We will learn how to change the name of a group and how to modify its GID using practical examples.

The lab covers the following steps: understanding the purpose and syntax of the `groupmod` command, modifying a group's name using the `groupmod` command, and changing a group's GID using the `groupmod` command. The content is straightforward and the language is concise, providing a clear overview of the lab's objectives and content.
