# Summary

In this lab, we learned the purpose and syntax of the `groupmod` command in Linux, which is used to modify the attributes of an existing group, such as the group name and Group ID (GID). We explored how to use the `-n` (or `--new-name`) option to change the name of a group, and the `-g` (or `--gid`) option to change the group's GID. These commands provide a way to manage group settings on a Linux system.
