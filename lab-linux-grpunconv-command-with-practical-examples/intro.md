# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `grpunconv` command, which is used to remove a group from the system by converting the group file to a shadow file format. We will learn how to use the `grpunconv` command, including understanding its purpose and syntax, removing a group from the system, and troubleshooting any errors or edge cases that may arise. This lab covers user and permission management skills, providing practical examples to help you effectively manage groups in your Linux environment.
