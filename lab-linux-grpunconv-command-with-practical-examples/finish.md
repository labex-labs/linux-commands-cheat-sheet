# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and syntax of the `grpunconv` command, which is used to convert the `/etc/group` file back to the traditional format, removing the password field and effectively disabling group-level passwords. We then learned how to remove a group from the system using the `grpunconv` command, by first creating a new group named "testgroup" and then using `grpunconv` to convert the group file.
