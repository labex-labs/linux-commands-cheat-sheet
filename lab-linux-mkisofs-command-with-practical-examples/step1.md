# Introduction to mkisofs Command

In this step, we will explore the `mkisofs` command, a powerful tool for creating ISO images on Linux. The `mkisofs` command is part of the `cdrkit` package, which provides a set of tools for working with CD/DVD media.

The `mkisofs` command is used to create an ISO image file from a directory tree. This ISO image can then be burned to a CD or DVD, or used in a virtual machine or other environment.

Let's start by installing the `cdrkit` package, which includes the `mkisofs` command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cdrkit
```
