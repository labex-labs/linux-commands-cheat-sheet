# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mkisofs` command, a powerful tool for creating ISO images. The `mkisofs` command is part of the `cdrkit` package, which provides a set of tools for working with CD/DVD media. We will learn how to create a basic ISO image and customize it with directories and files. The `mkisofs` command is used to create an ISO image file from a directory tree, which can then be burned to a CD or DVD, or used in a virtual machine or other environment.

To use the `mkisofs` command, we first need to install the `cdrkit` package. Once installed, we can create a basic ISO image by specifying the output file and the directory containing the content for the ISO. We can also customize the ISO image by adding directories and files to the content directory.
