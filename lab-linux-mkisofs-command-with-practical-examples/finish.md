# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `mkisofs` command, a powerful tool for creating ISO images on Linux. We first installed the `cdrkit` package, which includes the `mkisofs` command. Then, we created a basic ISO image by using the `mkisofs` command to generate an ISO file from a directory. Finally, we learned how to customize the ISO image by adding directories and files to the content.
