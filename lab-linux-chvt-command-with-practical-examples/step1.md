# Understand the chvt Command

In this step, you will learn about the `chvt` command in Linux, which stands for "change virtual terminal". The `chvt` command allows you to switch between different virtual terminals (VTs) or consoles on your system.

Virtual terminals are separate login sessions that run in the background, and you can switch between them using keyboard shortcuts or the `chvt` command. This can be useful for tasks like monitoring system logs, running long-running processes, or accessing different environments.

To use the `chvt` command, simply run the following:

```
sudo chvt <terminal_number>
```

Replace `<terminal_number>` with the number of the virtual terminal you want to switch to. For example, `sudo chvt 2` will switch to virtual terminal 2.

Example output:

```
$ sudo chvt 2
```

The `chvt` command can also be used to list the currently available virtual terminals:

```
sudo chvt -l
```

Example output:

```
$ sudo chvt -l
VT1
VT2
VT3
VT4
VT5
VT6
```

This will display the list of virtual terminals on your system.
