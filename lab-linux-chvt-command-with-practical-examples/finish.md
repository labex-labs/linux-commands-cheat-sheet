# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `chvt` command in Linux, which allows you to switch between different virtual terminals (VTs) or consoles on your system. You understood that virtual terminals are separate login sessions that run in the background, and you can switch between them using keyboard shortcuts or the `chvt` command. You also learned how to list the available virtual terminals and switch between them using both keyboard shortcuts and the `chvt` command.

You then explored automating the virtual terminal switching process, which can be useful for tasks like monitoring system logs, running long-running processes, or accessing different environments.
