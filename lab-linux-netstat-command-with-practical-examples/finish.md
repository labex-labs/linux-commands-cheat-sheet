# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and basic syntax of the `netstat` command in Linux. The `netstat` command is a powerful tool for monitoring and troubleshooting network connections and network interface statistics. You explored the most common options used with `netstat`, such as `-a` to display all network connections and listening ports, `-n` to display numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames, and `-p` to display the process ID and name associated with each connection.

Next, you learned how to use the `netstat` command to explore and analyze network connections on your system. You started by displaying all active network connections, including both listening ports and established connections, using the `netstat -antp` command. This provided you with detailed information about the protocol, local and foreign addresses, connection state, and the process ID and program name associated with each connection.
