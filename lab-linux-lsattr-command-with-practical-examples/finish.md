# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `lsattr` command in Linux, which allows you to view the extended attributes of files and directories. You explored how to use the `lsattr` command to list the attributes of a single file or recursively list the attributes of all files in a directory. You also learned how to manage file attributes using the `lsattr` command, such as setting the immutable or append-only attributes on a file.
