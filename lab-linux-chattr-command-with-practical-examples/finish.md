# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Linux `chattr` command, which is used to change the attributes of files and directories. We first explored the basic syntax and common options of the `chattr` command, such as setting the immutable, append-only, and secure deletion attributes. Then, we practiced modifying file attributes using the `chattr` command, including setting the immutable attribute to protect important files from being deleted or modified. Overall, the `chattr` command is a powerful tool for managing file and directory attributes in Linux.
