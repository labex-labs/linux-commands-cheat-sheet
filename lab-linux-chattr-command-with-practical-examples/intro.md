# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the Linux `chattr` command, which is used to change the attributes of files and directories. We will explore how to use the `chattr` command to set and remove various file attributes, such as the immutable attribute that prevents a file from being deleted or modified. We will also see practical examples of using the `chattr` command to protect important files and directories.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the `chattr` command and its common options.
2. Modify file attributes using the `chattr` command, including setting the immutable and append-only attributes.
3. Protect important files with the immutable attribute.
