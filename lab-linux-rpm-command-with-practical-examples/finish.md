# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the rpm (Red Hat Package Manager) command, which is a powerful tool for managing packages in Linux distributions that use the RPM package format. We learned that the rpm command allows us to perform various package management tasks, such as installing, upgrading, and removing RPM packages, querying information about installed packages, verifying the integrity of installed packages, and managing package dependencies. We then learned how to install, upgrade, and remove RPM packages using the rpm command. Finally, we covered how to perform RPM package queries and verifications, which can be useful for troubleshooting and maintaining a healthy system.
