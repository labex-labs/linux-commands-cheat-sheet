# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `chrt` command in Linux, which is used to set and retrieve the real-time scheduling attributes of a running process. You started by checking the current real-time priority of a process, and then learned how to adjust the real-time priority of a process using the `chrt` command. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of time-critical applications or ensuring that important processes are scheduled with higher priority.
