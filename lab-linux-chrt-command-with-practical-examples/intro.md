# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `chrt` command to manage the real-time scheduling attributes of running processes. The `chrt` command allows you to adjust the real-time priority of a process and manage its scheduling policy, which can be useful for optimizing the performance of time-critical applications or ensuring that important processes are scheduled with higher priority.

You will start by understanding the purpose of the `chrt` command and how to check the current real-time priority of a process. Then, you will learn how to change the real-time priority and scheduling policy of a process using the `chrt` command. This knowledge can help you optimize system performance and ensure that critical tasks are executed in a timely manner.
