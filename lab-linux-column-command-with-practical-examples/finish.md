# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `column` command in Linux to format tabular data. We started by understanding the basic usage of the `column` command, where we created a sample file with tabular data and used the `column` command to format it into a table-like structure. We then explored more advanced usage of the `column` command, such as customizing the column delimiter, adjusting the column width, and formatting more complex data files. The `column` command provides a simple and effective way to present data in a clear and organized manner, making it easier to read and understand.
