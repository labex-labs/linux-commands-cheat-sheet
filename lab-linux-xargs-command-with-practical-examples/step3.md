# Combine xargs with Other Linux Commands for Powerful Workflows

In this final step, you will learn how to combine the `xargs` command with other Linux commands to create powerful workflows.

Let's start by creating a list of files in the current directory:

```
ls > files.txt
```

Now, we can use `xargs` to calculate the MD5 checksum of each file:

```
cat files.txt | xargs md5sum
```

Example output:

```
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e  files.txt
e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e  names.txt
e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e  urls.txt
```

In this example, `xargs` takes the input from `cat files.txt` and passes each file name as an argument to the `md5sum` command.

Next, let's use `xargs` to search for a specific string in the files:

```
cat files.txt | xargs grep -l "example"
```

Example output:

```
urls.txt
```

In this example, `xargs` takes the input from `cat files.txt` and passes each file name as an argument to the `grep -l "example"` command, which searches for the string "example" in each file and prints the file name if a match is found.

Finally, let's use `xargs` to create a backup of the files:

```
cat files.txt | xargs -I {} cp {} backups/{}
```

Example output:

```

```

In this example, `xargs -I {}` allows us to use a placeholder `{}` to represent the input from `cat files.txt`. The `cp {} backups/{}` command copies each file to the `backups/` directory.

The `xargs` command is a powerful tool that can be combined with various other Linux commands to create efficient and flexible workflows. By mastering the use of `xargs`, you can streamline your daily tasks and increase your productivity as a Linux user.
