# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basics of the xargs command in Linux, which allows you to execute commands with arguments passed from standard input. You created a text file with a list of names, used xargs to print each name, and created directories for each name. You also learned how to use xargs to execute the curl command on a list of URLs, suppressing the output and displaying the effective URL and HTTP status code. These examples demonstrate the versatility of xargs and how it can be combined with various other Linux commands to create powerful workflows.
