# Summary

In this lab, you will learn about the concept of aliases in Linux, which are shortcuts or nicknames for commands in the shell. Aliases can save you time and improve your productivity by allowing you to create custom commands. You will learn how to create and manage aliases in the current shell session, as well as how to persist them across shell sessions by storing them in the shell's configuration file.
