# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `alias` command to create custom shortcuts for frequently used commands. You will understand the concept of aliases, create and manage them in the current shell session, and persist them across shell sessions. This lab will help you improve your productivity and efficiency when working in the Linux command line.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the Concept of Aliases in Linux
2. Create and Manage Aliases in the Current Shell Session
3. Persist Aliases Across Shell Sessions

The `alias` command is a built-in feature in most Linux shells, and it does not require any additional installation. However, it's important to note that aliases are specific to the shell you are using, such as Bash or Zsh, and may not be available in all shell environments.
