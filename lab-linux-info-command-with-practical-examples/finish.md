# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and usage of the `info` command in Linux, which provides detailed information about Linux commands, utilities, and system functions in a hierarchical, hypertext-like format. We learned that the `info` command is similar to the `man` command but offers a more structured and interactive way to access documentation. We then examined the various options and navigational techniques available in the `info` command, allowing us to efficiently explore and retrieve information about different Linux commands and utilities.
