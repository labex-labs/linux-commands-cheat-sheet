# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `info` command, which provides detailed information about various Linux commands, utilities, and system functions. You will explore the purpose and usage of the `info` command, understand its options and navigational techniques, and apply it to retrieve information about different Linux tools. The lab covers the essential features of the `info` command, including its hierarchical, hypertext-like format, which allows you to navigate through related topics and cross-references more efficiently than the traditional `man` pages.
