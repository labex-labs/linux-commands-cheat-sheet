# Summary

In this lab, we introduced the jed text editor, a powerful and versatile tool for text processing and editing on Linux systems. We learned how to install jed on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container and explored the basic commands and navigation techniques, such as opening and saving files, moving within the editor, searching and replacing text. We also discussed how to customize the jed editor settings to suit our preferences.
