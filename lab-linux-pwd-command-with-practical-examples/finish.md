# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `pwd` command in Linux, which stands for "Print Working Directory" and is used to display the current working directory. You explored the behavior of the `pwd` command when navigating to different directories, observing how the output changes to reflect the current location in the file system. Finally, you learned how to combine the `pwd` command with other Linux commands to perform various tasks, such as navigating to a specific directory or executing commands in the current directory.
