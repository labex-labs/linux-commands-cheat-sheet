# Combine pwd with Other Linux Commands

In this final step, you will learn how to combine the `pwd` command with other Linux commands to perform more complex tasks.

One common use case is to use `pwd` to specify the current working directory when executing other commands. For example, let's create a new file in the current directory:

```bash
touch $(pwd)/new_file.txt
```

This will create a new file named `new_file.txt` in the current working directory, which is `/home/labex/project`.

You can also use `pwd` to navigate to a specific directory and then execute a command. For instance, let's navigate to the root directory and list the contents:

```bash
cd /
ls -l $(pwd)
```

Example output:

```
total 60
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Apr 28 06:54 bin
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Apr 28 06:54 boot
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root  4096 May  2 06:16 dev
drwxr-xr-x  92 root root  4096 May  2 06:16 etc
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Apr 28 06:54 home
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    33 Apr 28 06:54 initrd.img -> /boot/initrd.img-5.15.0-60-generic
drwxr-xr-x  20 root root  4096 Apr 28 06:54 lib
...
```

In this example, we first navigate to the root directory using `cd /`, and then use `pwd` to specify the directory to list the contents of using `ls -l`.

Combining `pwd` with other commands can be a powerful way to automate tasks and work more efficiently in the Linux command line.
