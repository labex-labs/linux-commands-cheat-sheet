# Understand the Purpose of the pwd Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `pwd` command in Linux. The `pwd` command stands for "Print Working Directory" and is used to display the current working directory.

To use the `pwd` command, simply type `pwd` in the terminal:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```
/home/labex/project
```

The output shows that the current working directory is `/home/labex/project`. This is the directory where the user is currently located.

The `pwd` command is useful when you need to know your current location in the file system. It can be used in combination with other commands to perform various tasks, such as navigating to a specific directory or executing commands in the current directory.
