# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `lndir` command in Linux, which is used to create symbolic links to a directory tree. This is particularly useful when you want to create a mirror of a directory structure without duplicating the actual files. You also learned how to use the `lndir` command to create symbolic links to a directory, allowing you to access the files in the destination directory as if they were physically present there. This is a useful tool for managing symbolic links and maintaining a consistent directory structure across multiple locations.
