# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Linux `lndir` command to create and manage symbolic links to a directory tree. The `lndir` command is particularly useful when you want to create a mirror of a directory structure without duplicating the actual files. You will start by understanding the purpose of the `lndir` command, then create symbolic links using it, and finally learn how to manage those symbolic links. This lab covers practical examples and use cases for the `lndir` command, which is a valuable tool for maintaining consistent directory structures across multiple locations.
