# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `psnice` command in Linux, which is used to adjust the priority of running processes. We learned how to check the current priority of a process using the `ps` command, and how to increase or decrease the priority of a process using the `psnice` command. We also discussed practical use cases of the `psnice` command, such as managing system resources and optimizing performance.

The key takeaways from this lab are:

1. The `psnice` command allows you to adjust the priority of running processes, with the nice value ranging from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).
2. You can use the `psnice` command to increase or decrease the priority of a process, which can be useful for managing system resources and optimizing performance.
3. The `ps` command can be used to check the current priority of a running process, with the `NI` column showing the nice value.
