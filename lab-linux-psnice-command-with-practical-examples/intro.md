# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `psnice` command in Linux, which is used to adjust the priority of running processes. The `psnice` command allows you to increase or decrease the priority of a process, which can be useful for managing system resources and optimizing performance. We will cover the basics of the `psnice` command and provide practical use cases to demonstrate its functionality.

The lab will guide you through adjusting the priority of running processes using the `psnice` command. You will learn how to check the current priority of a process, increase its priority, and decrease its priority. These techniques can be valuable for managing system resources and improving the performance of critical applications.
