# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the csplit command in Linux to split a file into multiple parts based on specified patterns or line numbers. The csplit command allows you to create new files from an existing file, where the new files are named with a prefix and a sequential number. This can be useful for breaking down large files into smaller, more manageable pieces. You will also learn how to customize the behavior of the csplit command using various options.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Understand the csplit Command
