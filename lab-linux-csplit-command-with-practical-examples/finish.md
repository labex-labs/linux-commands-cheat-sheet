# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the Linux `csplit` command, which is used to split a file into multiple parts based on specified patterns or line numbers. You understood the basic usage of `csplit`, including how to create new files with a prefix and sequential numbers, and how to customize its behavior with various options such as setting the file name prefix, the number of digits, and whether to suppress or keep the output files. You also practiced splitting a sample file into multiple parts based on lines containing the word "START".

The key learning points from this lab are: 1) the purpose and basic usage of the `csplit` command, 2) how to split a file into multiple parts based on patterns or line numbers, and 3) the available options to customize the `csplit` command's behavior.
