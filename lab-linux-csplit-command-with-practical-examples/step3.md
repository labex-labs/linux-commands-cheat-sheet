# Customize csplit Behavior with Options

In this step, you will learn how to customize the behavior of the `csplit` command using various options.

The `csplit` command supports several options that allow you to control the output file names, suppress output, and handle errors. Let's explore some of these options:

1. **Specify Output File Prefix**
   You can use the `-f` option to set a custom prefix for the output file names. For example, to use the prefix "part" instead of the default "xx", you can run:

   ```
   csplit large_file.txt '/START/' -f 'part' '{*}'
   ```

   This will create files named `part00`, `part01`, `part02`, and so on.

2. **Specify Output File Name Width**
   By default, `csplit` uses a 2-digit width for the output file names (e.g., `xx00`, `xx01`). You can change this using the `-n` option. For example, to use a 3-digit width:

   ```
   csplit large_file.txt '/START/' -n 3 '{*}'
   ```

   This will create files named `xxx000`, `xxx001`, `xxx002`, and so on.

3. **Suppress Output**
   If you don't want to see the output file names as they are created, you can use the `-s` option to suppress the output:

   ```
   csplit -s large_file.txt '/START/' '{*}'
   ```

4. **Keep Output Files on Error**
   Normally, `csplit` will delete any output files if an error occurs during the split operation. To keep the output files even if an error occurs, you can use the `-k` option:

   ```
   csplit -k large_file.txt '/START/' '{*}'
   ```

These options can be combined to customize the `csplit` command to suit your specific needs. For example, to use a custom prefix, 3-digit width, and keep the output files on error:

```
csplit -k -n 3 -f 'part' large_file.txt '/START/' '{*}'
```

Example output:

```
$ csplit -f 'part' large_file.txt '/START/' '{*}'
part000
part001
part002
```
