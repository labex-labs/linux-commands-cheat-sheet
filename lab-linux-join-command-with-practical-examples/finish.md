# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `join` command in Linux, which is used to merge two or more files based on a common field. You started by creating sample files and understanding the basic syntax of the `join` command, including the use of options like `-t`, `-i`, `-1`, and `-2` to specify the delimiter, ignore case, and select the fields to join on. You then practiced joining two files based on a common field, demonstrating how the `join` command can merge records from different files into a single output.
