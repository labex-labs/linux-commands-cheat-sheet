# Handle Floating-Point Numbers with sum

In the previous step, we saw that the `sum` command can handle floating-point numbers. In this step, we will explore this feature in more detail.

The `sum` command uses different algorithms to calculate the checksum, and the behavior may vary when dealing with floating-point numbers. Let's examine this in more detail.

First, let's create a file with some floating-point numbers:

```
echo "3.14 6.28 9.42" > float_numbers.txt
```

Now, let's calculate the checksum using the default algorithm:

```
sum float_numbers.txt
```

Example output:

```
18.84 3 float_numbers.txt
```

As you can see, the `sum` command correctly handles the floating-point numbers and provides the checksum.

Next, let's try using the BSD algorithm with the `-r` option:

```
sum -r float_numbers.txt
```

Example output:

```
18 3 float_numbers.txt
```

Notice that the checksum value is different when using the BSD algorithm. This is because the BSD algorithm rounds the floating-point numbers to integers before calculating the checksum.

Finally, let's use the System V algorithm with the `-w` option:

```
sum -w float_numbers.txt
```

Example output:

```
18 3 float_numbers.txt
```

The System V algorithm also rounds the floating-point numbers to integers, similar to the BSD algorithm.

In summary, the `sum` command can handle floating-point numbers, but the behavior may vary depending on the algorithm used. The default algorithm preserves the floating-point precision, while the BSD and System V algorithms round the numbers to integers.

When working with files containing floating-point numbers, it's important to be aware of the algorithm used and its impact on the checksum calculation.
