# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `sum` command in Linux to calculate the checksum of files and perform basic summation operations. The `sum` command generates a checksum value that can be used to verify the integrity of data during file transfers or backups. You will explore the basic syntax of the `sum` command, learn how to calculate the checksum of single and multiple files, and practice using the command to perform basic summation operations on files.

The lab covers the following steps: understanding the `sum` command, performing basic summation operations, and handling floating-point numbers with `sum`. The `sum` command is a standard Linux utility and does not require any additional installation.
