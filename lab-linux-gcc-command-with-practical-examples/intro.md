# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler to compile and optimize C programs on a Linux system. You will start by understanding the basics of the GCC compiler, including its common command-line options. Then, you will compile a simple C program and explore the GCC optimization flags to improve the performance of your code.

The lab covers the following steps:

- Understand the Basics of GCC Compiler
- Compile a Simple C Program with GCC
- Explore GCC Compiler Optimization Flags

The GCC compiler is a crucial tool for building C and C++ programs on Linux, and this lab will provide you with practical examples to help you become more proficient in using it.
