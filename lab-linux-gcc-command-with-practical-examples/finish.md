# Summary

In this lab, you first learned the basics of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler, including how to check the installed version and the common command-line options such as `-c`, `-o`, `-g`, `-Wall`, `-Werror`, and `-O<n>`. You then practiced compiling a simple C program using the `gcc` command, learning how to create a source file, compile it, and run the resulting executable. Finally, you explored GCC's optimization flags, which allow you to control the level of code optimization during the compilation process.
