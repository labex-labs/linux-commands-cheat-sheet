# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basics of the `ping` command in Linux, which is a network diagnostic tool used to test the connectivity between a local host and a remote host. You started by pinging the local loopback interface `127.0.0.1` and then pinging a remote host `google.com`. You also learned how to use the `ping` command to test the connectivity to both local and remote hosts, and how to troubleshoot network issues using the `ping` command.
