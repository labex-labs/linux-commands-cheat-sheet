# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the purpose and syntax of the `zdump` command in Linux. The `zdump` command is used to display time zone information, including the current time, the time in other time zones, and the offset from UTC. You explored the verbose output of the `zdump` command and understood the different options available, such as `-v` for verbose mode, `-c` to specify a range of dates, and `-s` to display the current time in the specified time zone(s).

In the second step, you learned how to use the `zdump` command to explore timezone information in various ways. You discovered how to display the current time in a specific timezone, as well as how to display the time in multiple timezones simultaneously. Additionally, you learned how to use the `zdump` command to display the time in a specific timezone over a range of dates.
