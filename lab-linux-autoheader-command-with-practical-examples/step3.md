# Generate Configuration Header Files with autoheader

In this step, we will learn how to use the `autoheader` command to generate configuration header files for a software project.

First, let's create a sample project directory and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir ~/project/sample-project
cd ~/project/sample-project
```

Next, we need to create a `configure.ac` file, which is a crucial part of the build process. This file contains information about the project's configuration and dependencies. Let's create a simple `configure.ac` file:

```bash
nano configure.ac
```

Add the following content to the file:

```
AC_INIT([Sample Project], [1.0], [example@email.com])
AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])
AC_OUTPUT
```

Now, let's run the `autoheader` command to generate the `config.h` template file:

```bash
autoheader
```

This will create a `config.h.in` file in the project directory. This file is a template for the final `config.h` file, which will be generated during the build process.

To see the contents of the generated `config.h.in` file, you can use the `cat` command:

```bash
cat config.h.in
```

The `config.h.in` file contains preprocessor macros and definitions that will be used throughout the project.
