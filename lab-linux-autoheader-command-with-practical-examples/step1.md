# Understand the Purpose of autoheader Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `autoheader` command in Linux. The `autoheader` command is a tool used in the process of generating configuration header files, which are essential for building software projects.

Configuration header files, often named `config.h`, contain preprocessor macros and definitions that are used throughout the project. These files are typically generated automatically during the build process, and `autoheader` is a crucial part of this process.

The main purpose of `autoheader` is to generate a template for the `config.h` file based on the information provided in the project's `configure.ac` or `configure.in` file. This template includes all the necessary macros and definitions that the project requires, making it easier for developers to maintain and update the configuration settings.

Let's start by checking the version of `autoheader` installed on our system:

```bash
autoheader --version
```

Example output:

```

As you can see, the `autoheader` command is part of the GNU Autoconf suite, which is a widely used tool for generating build scripts and configuration files for software projects.
