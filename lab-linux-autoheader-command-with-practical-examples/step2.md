# Install the Necessary Packages for autoheader

In this step, we will install the necessary packages to use the `autoheader` command on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container.

First, let's update the package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Next, we need to install the `autoconf` package, which provides the `autoheader` command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf
```

Once the installation is complete, we can verify the version of `autoheader` again:

```bash
autoheader --version
```

Example output:

```
autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.71

Now, we have all the necessary packages installed to use the `autoheader` command in our project.
