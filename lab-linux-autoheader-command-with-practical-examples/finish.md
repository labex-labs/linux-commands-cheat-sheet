# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose of the autoheader command, which is used to generate configuration header files essential for building software projects. We then installed the necessary packages, including the autoconf package, to use the autoheader command on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. Finally, we generated the configuration header files using the autoheader command, which creates a template for the config.h file based on the information provided in the project's configure.ac or configure.in file.
