# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the Linux `mrd` command, which is used to manage directories by allowing you to create, remove, and navigate directories more efficiently. You will explore the purpose, syntax, and practical examples of using the `mrd` command, which can be particularly useful when you need to clean up a directory structure with many subdirectories.
