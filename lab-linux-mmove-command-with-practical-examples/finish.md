# Summary

In this lab, you first learned about the Linux `mmove` command, which is used to move files and directories within your file system. You explored the basic syntax of the `mmove` command and its common options, such as `-i` for prompting before overwriting, `-f` for forcing the move operation, `-v` for displaying verbose output, and `-u` for only moving the file if the source is newer than the destination.

You then learned how to use the `mmove` command to move files and directories, including moving a file to a different directory and moving a directory to a new location. You also explored advanced `mmove` options, such as preserving file permissions and timestamps, and handling symbolic links during the move operation.
