# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the dstat command, a versatile system monitoring tool for Linux. We started by installing the dstat package and running the basic dstat command to get an overview of various system resources, including CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O. We then explored how to use dstat to monitor CPU utilization and memory usage in more detail. The dstat command provides real-time, detailed information about the system, allowing users to quickly identify and troubleshoot performance issues.
