# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux dstat command, a versatile system monitoring tool that provides detailed information about various system resources, including CPU, memory, network, and disk. We will start by introducing the dstat command and demonstrating how to use it to monitor CPU utilization and memory usage on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. The dstat command is a powerful tool for system administrators and developers who need to understand the performance and resource usage of their Linux systems.
