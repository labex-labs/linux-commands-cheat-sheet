# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `mdel` command in Linux, which is used to create multiple directories at once. You explored the basic syntax of the `mdel` command and its common options, such as `-p` to create intermediate directories and `-v` for verbose mode. You then practiced creating and managing multiple directories using the `mdel` command, including creating a complex directory structure with the `-p` option. Overall, the `mdel` command can be a time-saving feature when you need to create a directory structure with several levels.
