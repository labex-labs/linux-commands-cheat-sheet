# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `file` command and learn how to identify different types of files, including text files, binary files, and compressed files. We will start by using the `file` command to determine the type of various files, and then move on to handling compressed files.

The `file` command is a versatile tool that can be used to identify the type of a file based on its contents, even if the file extension doesn't match the actual file type. This can be particularly useful when dealing with unknown or unusual file types.
