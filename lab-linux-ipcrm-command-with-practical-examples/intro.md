# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `ipcrm` command, which is used to remove Inter-Process Communication (IPC) objects, such as shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphores. We will first understand the concept of IPC objects and how to list the existing ones on the system using the `ipcs` command. Then, we will learn the syntax and options of the `ipcrm` command to remove these IPC objects. This lab provides practical examples and insights into managing IPC resources on a Linux system.
