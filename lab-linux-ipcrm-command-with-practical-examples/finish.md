# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the concept of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) objects in Linux, including shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. We used the `ipcs` command to list the existing IPC objects on the system. Next, we learned how to use the `ipcrm` command to remove these IPC objects, with various options to target specific shared memory segments, message queues, or semaphores. Understanding IPC objects and the `ipcrm` command is essential for managing system resources and communication between processes in a Linux environment.
