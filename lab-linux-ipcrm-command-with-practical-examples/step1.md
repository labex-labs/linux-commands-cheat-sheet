# Understand IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Objects

In this step, we will explore the concept of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) objects in Linux. IPC objects are mechanisms that allow processes to communicate with each other and share data. The main types of IPC objects are:

1. **Shared Memory**: Allows processes to share a common memory region, enabling efficient data exchange.
2. **Message Queues**: Provide a way for processes to send and receive messages, allowing asynchronous communication.
3. **Semaphores**: Used for process synchronization, controlling access to shared resources, and preventing race conditions.

We will use the `ipcs` command to list the existing IPC objects on the system.

```bash
sudo ipcs
```

Example output:

```
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x00000000 0          labex      600        4096       1          dest
------ Semaphore Arrays --------
key        semid      owner      perms      nsems
0x00000000 0          labex      600        1
------ Message Queues --------
key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages
0x00000000 0          labex      660        0            0
```

This output shows that there are currently one shared memory segment, one semaphore array, and one message queue on the system.
