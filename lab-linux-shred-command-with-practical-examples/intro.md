# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `shred` command in Linux to securely delete files by overwriting their contents multiple times. This ensures that the deleted files cannot be recovered using common data recovery techniques. You will start by creating a sample file and then learn how to use the `shred` command to overwrite and remove the file. Additionally, you will explore various options available with the `shred` command, such as specifying the number of overwrite iterations and adding a final overwrite with zeros.

Next, you will learn how to use the `shred` command to securely delete multiple files at once. The `shred` command is a powerful tool for ensuring the complete and permanent deletion of sensitive data, preventing it from being recovered by unauthorized parties.
