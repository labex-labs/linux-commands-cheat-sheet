# Introduction to FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

In this step, we will learn about the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between computers over a network. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a remote server.

First, let's understand the basic components of an FTP system:

- **FTP Server**: The computer or server that hosts the files and provides the FTP service.
- **FTP Client**: The software or application used to connect to the FTP server and perform file transfer operations.
- **FTP Protocol**: The set of rules and commands that govern the communication between the FTP client and server.

FTP supports various file transfer modes, including:

- **ASCII mode**: Used for transferring text files, where the line endings are converted to match the client's operating system.
- **Binary mode**: Used for transferring non-text files, such as images, executables, or archives, where the file data is transferred without any modifications.

FTP also provides different authentication methods, including:

- **Anonymous FTP**: Where the user can connect to the server without providing a username and password.
- **Authenticated FTP**: Where the user needs to provide a valid username and password to connect to the server.

In the next step, we will learn how to connect to an FTP server using the `ftp` command in the Linux terminal.
