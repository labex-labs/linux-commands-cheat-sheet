In this lab, you will learn how to use the `nslookup` command, a powerful tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) and troubleshooting DNS-related issues. You will start by exploring the basic functionality of the `nslookup` command, including resolving domain names to their associated IP addresses and retrieving information about a domain's DNS records. Additionally, you will learn how to use `nslookup` to identify the DNS servers responsible for a domain, which can be helpful when troubleshooting DNS-related problems.

The lab covers the following steps:

1. Introduction to the `nslookup` Command
2. Performing Basic DNS Lookups with `nslookup`
3. Troubleshooting DNS Issues Using `nslookup`

By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively use the `nslookup` command to manage and troubleshoot DNS-related tasks in a Linux environment.
