# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `insmod` command in Linux, which is used to insert a kernel module into the running kernel. Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel as needed, providing additional functionality or drivers. We will learn how to compile a simple kernel module and use `insmod` to insert it into the running kernel.

The lab covers the following steps: introduction to the `insmod` command, compiling a kernel module, and inserting a kernel module with `insmod`. The `linux-headers-$(uname -r)` package is required to compile the kernel module, and the `insmod` command is used to insert the compiled module into the running kernel.
