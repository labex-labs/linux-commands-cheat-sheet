# Summary

In this lab, we explored the Linux `finger` command, which provides information about system users. We first learned how to install the `finger` command on our Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. Then, we discovered how to use the `finger` command to display information about users currently logged into the system, including their login name, real name, terminal, idle time, and login time. Additionally, we learned how to customize the `finger` command output to retrieve specific user information, such as the user's full name, email address, and other details.
