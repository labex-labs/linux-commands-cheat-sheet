# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `finger` command, which provides information about system users. The `finger` command is a useful tool for system administrators and users to quickly access user-related details. We will learn how to display user information, including login name, real name, terminal, idle time, login time, and other details. Additionally, we will cover how to customize the `finger` command output. This lab is focused on user and permission management skills.

The `finger` command is installed by default on most Linux distributions, but it may need to be installed on some systems. If the `finger` command is not installed, you can install it using your system's package manager. The `finger` command is a standard Linux tool, but it is worth noting that it may be considered outdated or deprecated in some modern Linux distributions, and alternative tools may be preferred.
