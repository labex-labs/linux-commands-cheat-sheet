# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `repquota` command and its practical applications. The lab covers understanding the purpose and syntax of the `repquota` command, retrieving disk quota information for a specific user, and managing disk quota limits for multiple users. We will learn how to use the `repquota` command to display disk usage and limits, set quota limits for users, and monitor the disk quota status on a Linux system.
