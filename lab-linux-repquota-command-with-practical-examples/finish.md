# Summary

In this lab, we first explored the purpose and syntax of the `repquota` command, which is used to display disk usage and limits for a specific user or group. We learned how to check the man page for the command and understand its various options, such as `-a` to display quota information for all filesystems, `-u` for users, and `-v` for verbose output. We then demonstrated how to retrieve disk quota information for a specific user, creating a new user named `testuser` and setting a disk quota limit for them, before using the `repquota` command to display the quota details.
