# Understand the Purpose of the unset Command

In this step, you will learn about the purpose of the `unset` command in Linux. The `unset` command is used to remove or delete variables or shell functions from the current shell environment.

First, let's create an environment variable and then unset it:

```bash
# Create an environment variable
export MY_VAR="Hello, World!"
echo $MY_VAR

# Unset the environment variable
unset MY_VAR
echo $MY_VAR
```

Example output:

```
Hello, World!

```

As you can see, after running the `unset MY_VAR` command, the `MY_VAR` environment variable is no longer accessible.

Next, let's create a shell function and then unset it:

```bash
# Create a shell function
my_function() {
  echo "This is a shell function."
}
my_function

# Unset the shell function
unset -f my_function
my_function
```

Example output:

```
This is a shell function.
bash: my_function: command not found
```

In this example, we first define a shell function called `my_function`, and then we use the `unset -f` command to remove the function from the current shell environment.

The `unset` command is a useful tool for managing the shell environment and cleaning up variables or functions that are no longer needed.
