# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose of the `unset` command in Linux, which is used to remove or delete variables or shell functions from the current shell environment. You first created an environment variable and a shell function, and then used the `unset` command to remove them. You also learned how to unset multiple environment variables at once, and how to check the result of the `unset` command by printing the variables. The `unset` command is a useful tool for managing the shell environment and cleaning up variables or functions that are no longer needed.
