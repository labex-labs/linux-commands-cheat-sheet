# Unset Shell Functions

In this step, you will learn how to unset shell functions in Linux.

Shell functions are user-defined commands that can be called like built-in commands. They are stored in the shell's memory and can be accessed throughout the current shell session.

Let's start by creating a simple shell function:

```bash
# Define a shell function
my_function() {
  echo "This is a shell function."
}

# Call the shell function
my_function
```

Example output:

```
This is a shell function.
```

Now, let's unset the shell function:

```bash
# Unset the shell function
unset -f my_function
my_function
```

Example output:

```
bash: my_function: command not found
```

As you can see, after running the `unset -f my_function` command, the `my_function` shell function is no longer accessible.

You can also use the `declare -f` command to list all the shell functions currently defined in your shell environment:

```bash
# List all shell functions
declare -f
```

This will display all the shell functions that are currently defined in your shell.

The `unset` command is a useful tool for managing the shell environment and cleaning up variables or functions that are no longer needed.
