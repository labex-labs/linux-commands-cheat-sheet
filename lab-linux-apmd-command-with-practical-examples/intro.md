# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `apmd` command, a tool for monitoring and managing the power status of your Linux system, particularly for laptops and other battery-powered devices. You will start by installing the `apmd` package and running the service, then explore how to monitor the battery status using various `apmd` commands. Finally, you will learn how to configure `apmd` for automated power management to optimize battery life.

The `apmd` command may require additional installation on some systems, as it is not always included by default. Additionally, the `apmd` command is an older tool, and more modern power management solutions, such as `tlp` or `powertop`, may be preferred in some cases.
