# Introduction to the apmd Command

In this step, you will learn about the `apmd` command, which is a tool used to monitor and manage the power status of your system. The `apmd` command is particularly useful for laptops and other battery-powered devices, as it allows you to monitor the battery level and configure power management settings.

First, let's check if the `apmd` package is installed on your system. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apmd
```

Example output:

```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  apmd
0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

The `apmd` package is now installed on your system. You can start the `apmd` service using the following command:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apmd start
```

Example output:

```
Starting ACPI Power Management Daemon: apmd.
```

The `apmd` service is now running, and you can use the `apmd` command to monitor and manage the power status of your system.
