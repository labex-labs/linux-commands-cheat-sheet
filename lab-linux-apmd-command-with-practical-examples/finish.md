# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the `apmd` command, which is a tool used to monitor and manage the power status of your system. You started by checking if the `apmd` package was installed on your system and then learned how to start the `apmd` service. You then explored how to use the `apmd` command to monitor the battery status of your system, including checking the current battery percentage and charging/discharging state, as well as more detailed information about the battery's design capacity, last full capacity, voltage, current, and temperature.

Next, you will learn how to configure `apmd` for automated power management, which will allow you to set up power-saving policies and actions based on the battery status.
