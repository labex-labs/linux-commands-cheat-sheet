# Display Current Date and Time

In this step, we will learn how to display the current date and time using the `clock` command.

First, let's check the current date and time:

```bash
clock
```

Example output:

```
The current date is: 2023-04-19
The current time is: 10:00:00
```

As you can see, the `clock` command displays the current date and time on the system.

You can also use the `date` command to display the current date and time:

```bash
date
```

Example output:

```
Wed Apr 19 10:00:00 UTC 2023
```

The `date` command provides a more detailed output, including the day of the week, month, day, time, and time zone.

Both the `clock` and `date` commands are useful for quickly checking the system's current date and time. You can use them interchangeably depending on your preference.
