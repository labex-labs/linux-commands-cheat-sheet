# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Linux `clock` command to display the current date and time, as well as set the system clock. The `clock` command is a useful tool for system administrators and users who need to manage the system time. We explored how to check the current date and time using the `clock` command, and then demonstrated how to set the system clock to a specific date and time using the `sudo clock -s` command. Additionally, we learned that the `date` command can also be used to display the current date and time in a more detailed format.
