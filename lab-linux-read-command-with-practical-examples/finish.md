# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `read` command in Linux, which is used to capture user input and store it in a variable. You also learned how to read user input and store it in a variable, as well as how to use the `-p` option to display a prompt for the user. Finally, you learned how to validate user input using the `read` command.

The `read` command has several optional flags, such as `-p` to display a prompt, `-s` to suppress the display of the user's input, `-n` to read only a specified number of characters, and `-t` to specify a timeout for the read operation. You can use these flags to customize the behavior of the `read` command to suit your needs.
