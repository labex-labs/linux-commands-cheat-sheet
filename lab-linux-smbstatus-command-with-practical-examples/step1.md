# Understand the Purpose of smbstatus Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `smbstatus` command in Linux. The `smbstatus` command is a tool used to display information about active SMB (Server Message Block) connections and shared resources on a system.

SMB is a network file-sharing protocol that allows users to access and share files, printers, and other resources over a network. The `smbstatus` command provides a way to monitor and troubleshoot SMB-related activities on a Linux system.

Let's start by running the `smbstatus` command without any options:

```bash
sudo smbstatus
```

Example output:

```
Service      pid     Machine       Connected at
-----------------------------------------------
```

As you can see, the output is currently empty, as there are no active SMB connections on the system.

The `smbstatus` command can display various information about SMB connections, including:

- The service name (e.g., file shares, printers)
- The process ID (PID) of the SMB server process
- The client machine name
- The time the connection was established

By understanding the output of the `smbstatus` command, you can gain insights into the SMB activity on your system, which can be useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security purposes.

In the next step, we will explore the different options and flags available with the `smbstatus` command.
