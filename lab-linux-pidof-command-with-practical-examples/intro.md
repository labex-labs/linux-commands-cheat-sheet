# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `pidof` command in Linux to find the process ID (PID) of a running process. The `pidof` command is a useful tool for system monitoring and management, as it allows you to quickly identify the PID of a process, which can be helpful when you need to interact with or terminate a specific process. You will start by understanding the basics of the `pidof` command, and then practice finding the PID of a running process and locating multiple processes with the same name.
