# Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations with dc

In this step, you will learn how to use the `dc` command to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Let's start by practicing some simple calculations in the `dc` interactive mode.

```
$ dc
```

To add two numbers:

```
5 7 +
```

Example output:

```
12
```

To subtract two numbers:

```
10 4 -
```

Example output:

```
6
```

To multiply two numbers:

```
3 4 *
```

Example output:

```
12
```

To divide two numbers:

```
15 3 /
```

Example output:

```
5
```

You can also chain multiple operations together:

```
2 3 + 4 *
```

Example output:

```
20
```

In the above example, we first added 2 and 3, then multiplied the result by 4.

To exit the `dc` interactive mode, you can type `quit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
