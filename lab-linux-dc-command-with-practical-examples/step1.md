# Understand the dc Command

In this step, you will learn about the `dc` command, a powerful command-line calculator tool in Linux. The `dc` command allows you to perform various arithmetic operations, including basic calculations, as well as more advanced operations like trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

Let's start by understanding the basic usage of the `dc` command.

To launch the `dc` interactive mode, simply type `dc` in the terminal:

```
$ dc
```

This will bring you to the `dc` prompt, where you can start entering your calculations.

Example output:

```
$
```

In the `dc` prompt, you can enter numeric values and perform various operations using the available commands. For example, to perform a simple addition, you can type:

```
3 4 +
```

Example output:

```
7
```

In the above example, we entered the numbers `3` and `4`, then used the `+` operator to add them together.

The `dc` command supports a wide range of arithmetic operations, including subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and more. You can also use functions like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, and others to perform advanced calculations.

To exit the `dc` interactive mode, you can type `quit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
