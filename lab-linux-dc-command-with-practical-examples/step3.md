# Utilize dc for Advanced Calculations

In this step, you will learn how to use the `dc` command to perform more advanced calculations, including trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponents.

Let's start by exploring some advanced operations in the `dc` interactive mode.

```
$ dc
```

To calculate the sine of a value:

```
30 s p
```

Example output:

```
0.5
```

To calculate the cosine of a value:

```
45 c p
```

Example output:

```
0.7071067811865476
```

To calculate the natural logarithm of a value:

```
10 l p
```

Example output:

```
2.302585092994046
```

To calculate the base-10 logarithm of a value:

```
100 L p
```

Example output:

```
2
```

To calculate the exponential of a value:

```
2 e p
```

Example output:

```
7.38905609893065
```

You can also combine these advanced operations with basic arithmetic to perform more complex calculations.

To exit the `dc` interactive mode, you can type `quit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
