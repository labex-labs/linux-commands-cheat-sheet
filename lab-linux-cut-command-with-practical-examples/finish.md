# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the syntax and options of the `cut` command in Linux, which is a powerful tool for extracting specific columns or fields from a text file or the output of a command. You also learned how to use the `cut` command to extract specific columns from a text file, including the ability to change the delimiter in the output.

The lab covered the following key points:

1. Understanding the basic syntax of the `cut` command, including the use of the `-d` option to specify the delimiter and the `-f` option to select the fields to extract.
2. Exploring additional options such as `-c` to extract characters instead of fields, and `--complement` to select the complement of the set of bytes, characters, or fields.
3. Demonstrating how to extract specific columns from a text file using the `cut` command, and how to customize the output delimiter using the `--output-delimiter` option.
