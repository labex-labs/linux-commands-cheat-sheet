# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to write and execute a simple shell script, as well as how to use variables and command substitution in shell scripts. You started by creating a shell script that prints "Hello, World!" and made it executable. Then, you explored using variables to store and reuse values, and incorporated the output of commands into your script using command substitution. These fundamental concepts provide a solid foundation for building more complex shell scripts to automate various tasks on your Linux system.
