# Introduction to the dip Command

In this step, we will explore the `dip` command, which is a tool used to establish dial-up connections in Linux. The `dip` command allows you to configure and manage dial-up connections, making it a useful tool for networking and communication tasks.

First, let's check the version of the `dip` command installed on our system:

```bash
dip --version
```

Example output:

```
dip version 3.3.7
```

The `dip` command provides several subcommands that allow you to perform various tasks related to dial-up connections. Some of the commonly used subcommands include:

- `dip init`: Initializes a dial-up connection.
- `dip connect`: Establishes a dial-up connection.
- `dip disconnect`: Terminates a dial-up connection.
- `dip status`: Displays the status of a dial-up connection.
- `dip chat`: Handles the chat script for a dial-up connection.

To get a list of all available subcommands, you can use the `dip help` command:

```bash
dip help
```

This will display a list of all the available subcommands and their descriptions.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the `dip` command, let's move on to the next step, where we will learn how to establish a dial-up connection using `dip`.
