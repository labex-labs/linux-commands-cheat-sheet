# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `mattrib` command and learn how to manage file and directory attributes. The `mattrib` command allows you to set various attributes, such as read-only, hidden, and system, on individual files and directories. We will cover the purpose and syntax of the `mattrib` command, as well as practical examples of modifying file and directory attributes using this tool. This lab will provide you with the knowledge to effectively control the behavior and visibility of files and directories on your Linux system.
