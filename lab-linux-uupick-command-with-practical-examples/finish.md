# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `uupick` command, which is used to extract files from UUENCODE encoded emails. We first installed the `sharutils` package, which includes the `uupick` command. We then learned how to use the `uupick` command to extract files from UUENCODE encoded data. Finally, we explored automating the `uupick` command using shell scripts to simplify the process of extracting files from UUENCODE encoded emails.
