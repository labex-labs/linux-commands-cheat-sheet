# Explore Advanced ytalk Features and Functionalities

In this step, we will explore some of the advanced features and functionalities of the `ytalk` command.

First, let's learn how to send a private message to a specific user within the `ytalk` session:

```bash
ytalk -p labex "This is a private message."
```

This will send a private message to the user `labex` that only they can see.

Next, let's learn how to send a message to multiple users at once:

```bash
ytalk -a "This message will be sent to all users."
```

This will broadcast the message to all users currently in the `ytalk` session.

You can also use the `ytalk` command to check who is currently logged in to the system:

```bash
ytalk -l
```

This will display a list of all users currently logged in to the system.

Finally, let's learn how to customize the `ytalk` session by changing the terminal window title:

```bash
ytalk -t "Project Discussion"
```

This will change the terminal window title to "Project Discussion" for the duration of the `ytalk` session.

Remember, you can combine these advanced features as needed to enhance your collaborative experience using `ytalk`.
