# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to install the `ytalk` package on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container. `ytalk` is a command-line tool that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. We updated the package index and then installed the `ytalk` package, along with its dependencies, using the `apt-get` command. This step provided the necessary setup to enable the use of the `ytalk` command in the subsequent steps.

Next, we will explore how to initiate a `ytalk` session between two users and discover the advanced features and functionalities of the `ytalk` command.
