# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Linux `ytalk` command, a real-time communication tool that allows users to chat with each other directly from the command line. We will start by installing the `ytalk` package on an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, then initiate a `ytalk` session between two users, and finally, dive into the advanced features and functionalities of this versatile tool.

The `ytalk` command is a useful networking and communication utility that has been around for a while, but it may not be pre-installed on all Linux distributions. In this lab, we will ensure that the `ytalk` package is installed and ready for use, providing a seamless experience for our users.
