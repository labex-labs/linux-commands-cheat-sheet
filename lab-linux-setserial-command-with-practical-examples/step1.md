# Understand the Purpose of setserial Command

In this step, we will explore the purpose of the `setserial` command in Linux. The `setserial` command is a powerful tool used to configure and manage serial port settings on a Linux system.

The `setserial` command allows you to:

- Identify the current configuration of serial ports
- Set various parameters for serial ports, such as baud rate, I/O address, and interrupt request (IRQ)
- Troubleshoot issues related to serial communication

To begin, let's use the `setserial` command to get information about the serial ports on your system.

```bash
sudo setserial -g /dev/ttyS*
```

Example output:

```
/dev/ttyS0 uart:16550A port:0x03f8 irq:4
/dev/ttyS1 uart:16550A port:0x02f8 irq:3
```

This command retrieves the current configuration of all serial ports (`/dev/ttyS*`) on the system. The output shows the UART type, I/O port address, and IRQ for each serial port.

Now, let's say you need to change the configuration of a serial port, such as setting the baud rate. You can use the `setserial` command to do this:

```bash
sudo setserial /dev/ttyS0 baud_base 115200 spd_cust
```

This command sets the baud rate of the `/dev/ttyS0` serial port to 115200 bps and enables custom baud rate settings.

The `setserial` command provides a wide range of options to configure various aspects of serial ports, such as:

- `spd_normal`: Set the standard baud rates
- `spd_cust`: Enable custom baud rates
- `spd_vhi`: Set the baud rate to 57600 bps
- `spd_hi`: Set the baud rate to 38400 bps
- `spd_shi`: Set the baud rate to 115200 bps

You can explore the full list of options by running `man setserial` in the terminal.
