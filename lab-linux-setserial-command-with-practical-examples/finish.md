# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the purpose and usage of the `setserial` command in Linux. We started by understanding how the `setserial` command can be used to identify the current configuration of serial ports, including the UART type, I/O port address, and IRQ. We then explored how to use the `setserial` command to configure various settings for serial ports, such as baud rate and custom baud rates. Finally, we learned how to use the `setserial` command to obtain detailed information about the serial ports on the system, including their device names, UART types, and other relevant details.
