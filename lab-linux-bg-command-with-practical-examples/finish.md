# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the purpose and syntax of the `bg` command in Linux, which is used to move a suspended (stopped) job to the background, allowing you to continue working in the foreground. You practiced suspending a foreground process using `Ctrl+Z` and then moving it to the background using the `bg` command. You also learned how to list and manage background processes, which can be useful for running long-running tasks without tying up your terminal session.
