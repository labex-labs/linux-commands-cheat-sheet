# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `bg` command in Linux to manage background processes. The `bg` command is used to move a suspended (stopped) job to the background, allowing you to continue working in the foreground. You will learn how to suspend a foreground process, move it to the background, and list and manage background processes. The lab covers the purpose and syntax of the `bg` command, as well as practical examples of its usage.
