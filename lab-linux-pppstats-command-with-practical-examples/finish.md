# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the pppstats command in Linux, which is used to monitor the statistics of a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) interface. You started by installing the ppp package and running the pppstats command to display the current statistics of a PPP interface. You also learned how to specify a particular PPP interface to monitor and how to display the statistics in a more readable format. Additionally, you discovered how to use the pppstats command to continuously monitor the statistics of a PPP interface in real-time.
