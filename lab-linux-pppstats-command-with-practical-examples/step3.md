# Analyzing PPP Connection Performance

In this step, you will learn how to use the `pppstats` command to analyze the performance of a PPP connection.

First, let's start a PPP connection using the `pon` command:

```bash
sudo pon
```

Now, you can use the `pppstats` command to monitor the connection performance over time:

```bash
pppstats -r -i ppp0 -t 2
```

This will display the PPP interface statistics every 2 seconds for the `ppp0` interface.

Example output:

```
  bytes_in   bytes_out    pkts_in   pkts_out  bpf_drops  carrier
    123456       78901       1234        567           0        1
    234567      123456       2345       1234           0        1
    345678      234567       3456       2345           0        1
```

You can analyze the following metrics to understand the performance of the PPP connection:

- **Bytes In/Out**: The number of bytes received and transmitted over the PPP interface. This can indicate the data throughput of the connection.
- **Packets In/Out**: The number of packets received and transmitted over the PPP interface. This can indicate the packet rate of the connection.
- **BPF Drops**: The number of packets dropped by the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF). This can indicate network congestion or packet loss.
- **Carrier**: The number of carrier changes, which can indicate physical layer issues with the connection.

By monitoring these statistics over time, you can identify any performance issues or bottlenecks in the PPP connection.

To stop the PPP connection, use the `poff` command:

```bash
sudo poff
```

This will terminate the PPP connection and stop the `pppstats` monitoring.
